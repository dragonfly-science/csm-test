	abstract = {Forest canopy height model ({CHM}) is useful for analyzing forest stocking and its spatiotemporal variations. However, high-resolution {CHM} with regional coverage is commonly unavailable due to the high cost of {LiDAR} data acquisition and computational cost associated with data processing. We present a {CHM} generation method using U.S. Geological Survey ({USGS}) 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) {LiDAR} data for tree height measurement capabilities for entire state of Indiana, {USA}. The accuracy of height measurement was investigated in relation to {LiDAR} point density, inventory height, and the timing of data collection. A simple data exploratory analysis ({DEA}) was conducted to identify problematic input data. Our {CHM} model has high accuracy compared to field-based height measurement (R2 = 0.85) on plots with relatively accurate {GPS} locations. Our study provides an easy-to-follow workflow for 3DEP {LiDAR} based {CHM} generation in a parallel processing environment for a large geographic area. In addition, the resulting {CHM} can serve as critical baseline information for monitoring and management decisions, as well as the calculation of other key forest metrics such as biomass and carbon storage.},

	abstract = {Spatially-explicit information on forest structure is paramount to estimating aboveground carbon stocks for designing sustainable forest management strategies and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. {LiDAR} measurements provide samples of forest structure that must be integrated with satellite imagery to predict and to map landscape scale variations of forest structure. Here we evaluate the capability of existing satellite synthetic aperture radar ({SAR}) with multispectral data to estimate forest canopy height over five study sites across two biomes in North America, namely temperate broadleaf and mixed forests and temperate coniferous forests. Pixel size affected the modelling results, with an improvement in model performance as pixel resolution coarsened from 25m to 100m. Likewise, the sample size was an important factor in the uncertainty of height prediction using the Support Vector Machine modelling approach. Larger sample size yielded better results but the improvement stabilised when the sample size reached approximately 10\% of the study area. We also evaluated the impact of surface moisture (soil and vegetation moisture) on the modelling approach. Whereas the impact of surface moisture had a moderate effect on the proportion of the variance explained by the model (up to 14\%), its impact was more evident in the bias of the models with bias reaching values up to 4m. Averaging the incidence angle corrected radar backscatter coefficient (γ°) reduced the impact of surface moisture on the models and improved their performance at all study sites, with R2 ranging between 0.61 and 0.82, {RMSE} between 2.02 and 5.64 and bias between 0.02 and −0.06, respectively, at 100m spatial resolution. An evaluation of the relative importance of the variables in the model performance showed that for the study sites located within the temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome {ALOS}-{PALSAR} {HV} polarised backscatter was the most important variable, with Landsat Tasselled Cap Transformation components barely contributing to the models for two of the study sites whereas it had a significant contribution at the third one. Over the temperate conifer forests, Landsat Tasselled Cap variables contributed more than the {ALOS}-{PALSAR} {HV} band to predict the landscape height variability. In all cases, incorporation of multispectral data improved the retrieval of forest canopy height and reduced the estimation uncertainty for tall forests. Finally, we concluded that models trained at one study site had higher uncertainty when applied to other sites, but a model developed from multiple sites performed equally to site-specific models to predict forest canopy height. This result suggest that a biome level model developed from several study sites can be used as a reliable estimator of biome-level forest structure from existing satellite imagery.},

	abstract = {Small Footprint {LiDAR} (Light Detection And Ranging) has been proposed as an effective tool for measuring detailed biophysical characteristics of forests over broad spatial scales. However, by itself {LiDAR} yields only a sample of the true 3D structure of a forest. In order to extract useful forestry relevant information, this data must be interpreted using mathematical models and computer algorithms that infer or estimate specific forest metrics. For these outputs to be useful, algorithms must be validated and/or calibrated using a sub-sample of ‘known’ metrics measured using more detailed, reliable methods such as field sampling. In this paper we describe a novel method for delineating and deriving metrics of individual trees from {LiDAR} data based on watershed segmentation. Because of the costs involved with collecting both {LiDAR} data and field samples for validation, we use synthetic {LiDAR} data to validate and assess the accuracy of our algorithm. This synthetic {LiDAR} data is generated using a simple geometric model of Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) trees and a simulation of {LiDAR} sampling. Our results suggest that point densities greater than 2 and preferably greater than 4 points per m2 are necessary to obtain accurate forest inventory data from Loblolly pine stands. However the results also demonstrate that the detection errors (i.e. the accuracy and biases of the algorithm) are intrinsically related to the structural characteristics of the forest being measured. We argue that experiments with synthetic data are directly useful to forest managers to guide the design of operational forest inventory studies. In addition, we argue that the development of {LiDAR} simulation models and experiments with the data they generate represents a fundamental and useful approach to designing, improving and exploring the accuracy and efficiency of {LiDAR} algorithms.},

	abstract = {Regarded as a marked category of global forests, forest plantations not only have great significance for the development of the global economy, but also contribute ecological and social benefits. The accurate acquisition of the multi-scale (from individual tree to landscape level) and near-real-time information of structural parameters in plantations is the premise of decision-making in sustainable management for the whole forest farm, and it is also the basis for the evaluation of forest productivity in stands. The development and synergetic applications of multi-source and multi-platform remote sensing technology provide a technical basis for the highly accurate estimation of multi-scale forest structural parameters. In this study, we developed an advanced framework for estimating these parameters of forest plantations in multiple scales (individual tree, plot and landscape levels) based on the Unmanned Aircraft System Light Detection and Ranging ({UAS}-{LiDAR}) transects and wall-to-wall Sentinel-2 imagery, combined with the sample plot data in a typical forest farm plantation (mainly Larch, Chinese pine) of Northern China. The position and height of individual trees within the plots were extracted by the {LiDAR}-based point cloud segmentation ({PCS}) algorithm, and then different approaches to the extrapolation of forest structural parameters from the plot to landscape level were assessed. The results demonstrate that, firstly, the individual tree height obtained by {PCS} was of relatively high accuracy ({rRMSE} = 1.5–3.3\%); secondly, the accuracy of the forest structure parameters of the sample plot scale estimated by {UAS}-{LiDAR} is {rRMSE} = 4.4–10.6\%; and thirdly, the accuracy of the two-stage upscaling approach by {UAS}-{LiDAR} transects as an intermediate stage ({rRMSE} = 14.5–20.2\%) performed better than the direct usage of Sentinel-2 data ({rRMSE} = 22.9–27.3\%). This study demonstrated an advanced framework for creating datasets of multi-scale forest structural parameters in a forest plantation, and proved that the synergetic usage of {UAS}-{LiDAR} transects and full coverage medium-resolution satellite imagery can provide a high-precision and low-cost technical basis for the multi-level estimation of forest structural parameters.},

	abstract = {Accurate estimation and extrapolation of forest structural parameters in planted forests are essential for monitoring forest resources, investigating their ecosystem services (e.g., forest structure and functions), as well as supporting decisions for precision silviculture. Advances in unmanned aerial vehicle ({UAV})-borne Light Detection and Ranging ({LiDAR}) technology have enhanced our ability to precisely characterize the 3-D structure of the forest canopy with high flexibility, usually within forest plots and stands. For wall-to-wall forest structure mapping in broader landscapes, samples (transects) of {UAV}-{LiDAR} datasets are a cost-efficient solution as an intermediate layer for extrapolation from field plots to full-coverage multispectral satellite imageries. In this study, an advanced two-stage extrapolation approach was established to estimate and map large area forest structural parameters (i.e., mean {DBH}, dominant height, volume, and stem density), in synergy with field plots and {UAV}-{LiDAR} and {GF}-6 satellite imagery, in a typical planted forest of southern China. First, estimation models were built and used to extrapolate field plots to {UAV}-{LiDAR} transects; then, the maps of {UAV}-{LiDAR} transects were extrapolated to the whole study area using the wall-to-wall grid indices that were calculated from {GF}-6 satellite imagery. By comparing with direct prediction models that were fitted by field plots and {GF}-6-derived spectral indices, the results indicated that the two-stage extrapolation models (R2 = 0.64–0.85, {rRMSE} = 7.49–26.85\%) obtained higher accuracy than direct prediction models (R2 = 0.58–0.75, {rRMSE} = 21.31–38.43\%). In addition, the effect of {UAV}-{LiDAR} point density and sampling intensity for estimation accuracy was studied by sensitivity analysis as well. The results showed a stable level of accuracy for approximately 10\% of point density (34 pts·m−2) and 20\% of sampling intensity. To understand the error propagation through the extrapolation procedure, a modified U-statistics uncertainty analysis was proposed to characterize pixel-level estimates of uncertainty and the results demonstrated that the uncertainty was 0.75 cm for mean {DBH}, 1.23 m for dominant height, 14.77 m3·ha−1 for volume and 102.72 n·ha−1 for stem density, respectively.},

	abstract = {Accurate quantification of grassland structural and functional traits is the foundation for grassland management and restoration. Light detection and ranging (lidar), especially the unmanned aerial vehicle ({UAV}) lidar, has been recognized as an accurate and effective technique for local to regional-scale vegetation structural and functional traits estimation. However, in grassland ecosystems, it is more likely to be influenced by {UAV} lidar information loss caused by dense vegetation canopies. In this study, we investigated how {UAV} lidar information loss may occur and how it may influence the estimation accuracy of grassland structural and functional traits by comparing it with terrestrial laser scanning ({TLS}) and field measurements in a meadow steppe of northern China. Five structural traits (i.e., mean vegetation height, maximum vegetation height, standard deviation of vegetation height, canopy cover, and canopy volume) and one functional trait (i.e., aboveground biomass) were estimated from the {UAV} lidar data and {TLS} data for evaluation. The results showed that {TLS}-derived structural and functional traits had a much higher accuracy than {UAV} lidar-derived traits. By comparing with {TLS} data, we found that {UAV} lidar data had a much more prevailing information loss at canopy tops than at canopy bottoms. The average height loss of {UAV} lidar at canopy tops reached over 0.30 m, and the average relative height loss reached over 49\%, comparing to a value of 0.03 m and 6\% at canopy bottoms. Maximum vegetation height, standard deviation, and the distance from the {UAV} lidar system to the ground were the three most influential factors on {UAV} lidar information loss at canopy tops, indicating the commonly seen sharp canopy tops of grasslands were prone to be missed by the {UAV} lidar system. {UAV} lidar information loss at canopy tops had a much stronger influence on the estimation accuracy of grassland structural and functional traits than that at canopy bottoms. With the decrease of information loss at canopy tops, {UAV} lidar can be used to extract grassland structural and functional traits with a comparable accuracy to {TLS}. Among the five grassland traits, aboveground biomass was the least influenced by {UAV} lidar information loss. This study is a very first evaluation on the {UAV} lidar information loss in grassland ecosystems and its influence on grassland structural and functional trait estimation, which can provide guidance for {UAV} lidar data collection and processing in future grassland applications.},

	abstract = {Forest above-ground biomass ({AGB}) is an important index to evaluate forest carbon sequestration capacity, which is very important to maintain the stability of forest ecosystems. At present, the wide use of remote sensing technology makes it possible to estimate the large-scale forest {AGB} accurately and efficiently. Airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data can obtain rich spectral information and spatial structure information on the forest canopy with the characteristics of high spatial and hyperspectral resolution. Airborne {LiDAR} data can describe the three-dimensional structure characteristics of a forest and provide vertical structure information related to biomass. Based on the characteristics of the two data sources, this study takes Gaofeng forest farm in Nanning, Guangxi, as the study area, Chinese fir, pine tree, eucalyptus and other broadleaved trees as the research object, and constructs the {AGB} estimation models of different tree species by fusing airborne {LiDAR} and hyperspectral features. Firstly, spectral features, texture features, vegetation index, wavelet transform features and edge features are extracted from hyperspectral data. Canopy structure features, point cloud structure features, point cloud density features and terrain features are extracted from airborne {LiDAR} data. Secondly, the random forest ({RF}) method is used to screen the features of the two sets of data, and the features with the highest importance are selected. Finally, based on the optimal features of the two data sources, the forest {AGB} model is constructed using the multiple stepwise regression method. The results show that the texture features extracted by wavelet transform can be used for {AGB} modeling. The {AGB} of eucalyptus has high correlation with height features derived from airborne {LiDAR}, the {AGB} of other broadleaved trees mostly depends on the wavelet transform texture features from airborne hyperspectral data, while the {AGB} of Chinese fir and pine tree has high correlation with both height features and spectral features. Feature-fusion-based {LiDAR} and hyperspectral data can greatly improve the accuracy of the {AGB} models. The accuracy of the optimal {AGB} models of Chinese fir, pine tree, eucalyptus and other broadleaved trees is 0.78, 0.95, 0.72 and 0.89, respectively. In conclusion, more accurate estimation results can be obtained by combining active and passive remote sensing data for forest {AGB} estimation, which provides a solution for carbon storage assessment and forest ecosystem assessment.},

	abstract = {Mapping mangrove species is important for mangrove conservation and rehabilitation. However, due to the similar spectral signatures of most mangrove species, accurately mapping mangrove species remains an ongoing challenge. Unmanned aerial vehicles paired with light detection and ranging sensors ({UAV}-{LiDAR}) have the potential to increase separability between mangrove species by providing vertical structure information with high flexibility and low cost and could be complementary to optical imagery. In this study, we combined {UAV}-{LiDAR} and Sentinel-2 data to classify mangrove species in two representative mangrove forests in China. Moreover, an architecture diagram of important features for discriminating mangrove species was first constructed using a modified recursive feature elimination method and a proposed step-by-step method, including hierarchical clustering, scatterplots, and boxplots. This architecture diagram could indicate the specific role of each feature (or group) in demarcating specific mangrove species and help other mangrove studies prepare candidate features. The combined {UAV}-{LiDAR} and Sentinel-2 data produced the highest overall accuracies of 85.60\% and 91.61\% in the Dongzhaigang National Nature Reserve and Qinglangang Provincial Nature Reserve areas, respectively, compared to those of the Sentinel-2 (80.00\% and 80.42\%, respectively) and {UAV}-{LiDAR} (77.60\% and 75.52\%, respectively) data alone by using the novel canonical correlation forest algorithm. Important {LiDAR} features included metrics describing the top, bottom, and overall (e.g., Hstd and {GM}2nd) morphological characteristics of the mangrove canopy, which characterized the vertical stratification and shape of the canopy. The added value of the {UAV}-{LiDAR} data mainly lies in improving the separability between shrub-like mangroves and arbor mangroves that had similar spectral signatures, such as A. marina and R. stylosa. The point density might have little effect on feature selection and classification accuracy, while 10\% of the initial point density (∼10 pts/m2) could produce similar accuracy (differences less than 0.5\%). This study suggests that the combined {UAV}-{LiDAR} and Sentinel-2 data provide a cost-efficient and accurate approach for mangrove species classification.},

However, {UAV} technological advances have outpaced practical application; thus, we explored combining {UAV}-borne lidar and hyperspectral data to evaluate the diversity and structure of restoration plantings. We developed novel analytical approaches to assess twelve 13-year-old restoration plots experimentally established with 20, 60 or 120 native tree species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We assessed (1) the congruence and complementarity of lidar and hyperspectral-derived variables, (2) their ability to distinguish tree richness levels and (3) their ability to predict aboveground biomass ({AGB}). We analyzed three structural attributes derived from lidar data—canopy height, leaf area index ({LAI}), and understory {LAI}—and eighteen variables derived from hyperspectral data—15 vegetation indices ({VIs}), two components of the minimum noise fraction (related to spectral composition) and the spectral angle (related to spectral variability). We found that {VIs} were positively correlated with {LAI} for low {LAI} values, but stabilized for {LAI} greater than 2 m2/m2. {LAI} and structural {VIs} increased with increasing species richness, and hyperspectral variability was significantly related to species richness. While lidar-derived canopy height better predicted {AGB} than hyperspectral-derived {VIs}, it was the fusion of {UAV}-borne hyperspectral and lidar data that allowed effective co-monitoring of both forest structural attributes and tree diversity in restoration plantings. Furthermore, considering lidar and hyperspectral data together more broadly supported the expectations of biodiversity theory, showing that diversity enhanced biomass capture and canopy functional attributes in restoration. The use of {UAV}-borne remote sensors can play an essential role during the {UN} Decade of Ecosystem Restoration, which requires detailed forest monitoring on an unprecedented scale.},

	abstract = {The detection of buildings in the city is essential in several geospatial domains and for decision-making regarding intelligence for city planning, tax collection, project management, revenue generation, and smart cities, among other areas. In the past, the classical approach used for building detection was by using the imagery and it entailed human–computer interaction, which was a daunting proposition. To tackle this task, a novel network based on an end-to-end deep learning framework is proposed to detect and classify buildings features. The proposed {CNN} has three parallel stream channels: the first is the high-resolution aerial imagery, while the second stream is the digital surface model ({DSM}). The third was fixed on extracting deep features using the fusion of channel one and channel two, respectively. Furthermore, the channel has eight group convolution blocks of 2D convolution with three max-pooling layers. The proposed model’s efficiency and dependability were tested on three different categories of complex urban building structures in the study area. Then, morphological operations were applied to the extracted building footprints to increase the uniformity of the building boundaries and produce improved building perimeters. Thus, our approach bridges a significant gap in detecting building objects in diverse environments; the overall accuracy ({OA}) and kappa coefficient of the proposed method are greater than 80\% and 0.605, respectively. The findings support the proposed framework and methodologies’ efficacy and effectiveness at extracting buildings from complex environments.},

	abstract = {Forests play a prominent role in the battle against climate change, as they absorb a relevant part of human carbon emissions. However, precisely because of climate change, forest disturbances are expected to increase and alter forests’ capacity to absorb carbon. In this context, forest monitoring using all available sources of information is crucial. We combined optical (Landsat) and photonic ({GEDI}) data to monitor four decades (1985–2019) of disturbances in Italian forests (11 Mha). Landsat data were confirmed as a relevant source of information for forest disturbance mapping, as forest harvestings in Tuscany were predicted with omission errors estimated between 29\% (in 2012) and 65\% (in 2001). {GEDI} was assessed using Airborne Laser Scanning ({ALS}) data available for about 6 Mha of Italian forests. A good correlation (r2 = 0.75) between Above Ground Biomass Density {GEDI} estimates ({AGBD}) and canopy height {ALS} estimates was reported. {GEDI} data provided complementary information to Landsat. The Landsat mission is capable of mapping disturbances, but not retrieving the three-dimensional structure of forests, while our results indicate that {GEDI} is capable of capturing forest biomass changes due to disturbances. {GEDI} acquires useful information not only for biomass trend quantification in disturbance regimes but also for forest disturbance discrimination and characterization, which is crucial to further understanding the effect of climate change on forest ecosystems.},

While dozens of crown detection algorithms have been proposed, their performance is typically not compared based on standard data or evaluation metrics. There is a need for a benchmark dataset to minimize differences in reported results as well as support evaluation of algorithms across a broad range of forest types. Combining {RGB}, {LiDAR} and hyperspectral sensor data from the {USA} National Ecological Observatory Network’s Airborne Observation Platform with multiple types of evaluation data, we created a benchmark dataset to assess crown detection and delineation methods for canopy trees covering dominant forest types in the United States. This benchmark dataset includes an R package to standardize evaluation metrics and simplify comparisons between methods. The benchmark dataset contains over 6,000 image-annotated crowns, 400 field-annotated crowns, and 3,000 canopy stem points from a wide range of forest types. In addition, we include over 10,000 training crowns for optional use. We discuss the different evaluation data sources and assess the accuracy of the image-annotated crowns by comparing annotations among multiple annotators as well as overlapping field-annotated crowns. We provide an example submission and score for an open-source algorithm that can serve as a baseline for future methods.},

	doi = {10.1080/01431161.2020.1820618},
	abstract = {The urban vegetation ecosystem is a vegetation ecosystem that is deeply influenced by human beings. The rapid urbanization process brings a great influence on the growth environment of urban vegetation. Urban vegetation has a certain mitigating effect on the urbanization process. It is irreplaceable by other urban ecosystems in functions such as maintaining atmospheric carbon–oxygen balance, reducing heat island effects, purifying, and beautifying the urban environment. At present, the estimation of aboveground biomass ({AGB}) mainly focuses on the original forest, grassland, desertification vegetation and crops, and the data sources are mostly medium- and low-resolution data such as Land Remote-Sensing Satellite Thematic Map (Landsat {TM}), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus ({ETM}+), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ({MODIS}). Compared with the research objects such as forest and grassland, urban vegetation has higher heterogeneity of underlying surface within the city scope, and there are more mixed pixels of medium- and low-resolution data. Therefore, high-resolution data are needed for classification and estimation. This study uses Light Detection and Ranging ({LiDAR}) data to expand the sample size, combines high-resolution image data to classify urban vegetation areas, and quantitatively estimates and inverts biomass. The spatial and temporal variation of urban vegetation biomass was analysed by comparing the inversion accuracy of five different models and the advantages and disadvantages of the research models. The research results show that: (1) In the absence of urban forest sample points, the biomass background data are expanded with the help of {LiDAR} data and more data is provided for further inversion; (2) Through five model method comparison experiments, the optimal method for estimation is based on the Random Forest ({RF}) model; (3) Analysed the changes of urban vegetation in the study area in the past 10 years, the development of different types of urban vegetation has experienced a trend of increasing first and then decreasing. Due to the high heterogeneity of features in urban areas, this study improved the inversion accuracy of estimating urban vegetation biomass by classification, and provided reference value and the basis for urban ecological management and regional planning.},

This research will help 3DEP determine if this sensor has the potential to meet current and future 3DEP topographic lidar collection requirements. We performed an accuracy analysis and assessment on the lidar point cloud produced from {CountryMapper}. The boresighting calibration and co-registration by georeferencing correction based on ground control points are assumed to be performed by the data provider. The scope of the accuracy assessment is to apply the following variety of ways to measure the accuracy of the delivered point cloud to obtain the error statistics. Intraswath uncertainty from a flat surface was computed to evaluate the point cloud precision. Intraswath difference between opposite scan directions and the interswath overlap difference were evaluated to find boresighting or any systematic errors. Absolute vertical accuracy over vegetated and non-vegetated areas were also assessed. Both horizontal and vertical absolute errors were assessed using the 3D absolute error analysis methodology of comparing conjugate points derived from geometric features. A three-plane feature makes a single unique intersection point. Intersection points were computed from ground-based lidar and airborne lidar point clouds for comparison. The difference between two intersection points form one error vector. The geometric feature-based error analysis was applied to intraswath, interswath, and absolute error analysis. The {CountryMapper} pilot data appear to satisfy the accuracy requirements suggested by the {USGS} lidar specification, based upon the error analysis results. The focus of this research was to demonstrate various conventional accuracy measures and novel 3D accuracy techniques using two different error computation methods on the {CountryMapper} airborne lidar point cloud.},

	doi = {10.1109/TGRS.2015.2428197},
	abstract = {Accurate tree-cover estimates are useful in deriving above-ground biomass density estimates from very high resolution ({VHR}) satellite imagery data. Numerous algorithms have been designed to perform tree-cover delineation in high-to-coarse-resolution satellite imagery, but most of them do not scale to terabytes of data, typical in these {VHR} data sets. In this paper, we present an automated probabilistic framework for the segmentation and classification of 1-m {VHR} data as obtained from the National Agriculture Imagery Program ({NAIP}) for deriving tree-cover estimates for the whole of Continental United States, using a high-performance computing architecture. The results from the classification and segmentation algorithms are then consolidated into a structured prediction framework using a discriminative undirected probabilistic graphical model based on conditional random field, which helps in capturing the higher order contextual dependence relations between neighboring pixels. Once the final probability maps are generated, the framework is updated and retrained by incorporating expert knowledge through the relabeling of misclassified image patches. This leads to a significant improvement in the true positive rates and reduction in false positive rates ({FPRs}). The tree-cover maps were generated for the state of California, which covers a total of 11 095 {NAIP} tiles and spans a total geographical area of 163 696 sq. miles. Our framework produced correct detection rates of around 88\% for fragmented forests and 74\% for urban tree-cover areas, with {FPRs} lower than 2\% for both regions. Comparative studies with the National Land-Cover Data algorithm and the {LiDAR} high-resolution canopy height model showed the effectiveness of our algorithm for generating accurate high-resolution tree-cover maps.},

	abstract = {{LiDAR} data are being increasingly used to provide a detailed characterization of the vertical profile of forests. This characterization enables the generation of new insights on the influence of environmental drivers and anthropogenic disturbances on forest structure as well as on how forest structure influences important ecosystem functions and services. Unfortunately, extracting information from {LiDAR} data in a way that enables the spatial visualization of forest structure, as well as its temporal changes, is challenging due to the high dimensionality of these data. We show how the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model applied to {LiDAR} data ({LidarLDA}) can be used to identify forest structural types and how the relative abundance of these forest types changes throughout the landscape. The code to fit this model is made available through the open-source r package {LidarLDA} in github. We illustrate the use of {LidarLDA} both with simulated data and data from a large-scale fire experiment in the Brazilian Amazon region. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that {LidarLDA} accurately identifies the number of forest types as well as their spatial distribution and absorptance probabilities. For the empirical data, we found that {LidarLDA} detects both landscape-level patterns in forest structure as well as the strong interacting effect of fire and forest fragmentation on forest structure based on the experimental fire plots. More specifically, {LidarLDA} reveals that proximity to forest edge exacerbates the impact of fires, and that burned forests remain structurally different from unburned areas for at least 7 years, even when burned only once. Importantly, {LidarLDA} generates insights on the 3D structure of forest that cannot be obtained using more standard approaches that just focus on top-of-the-canopy information (e.g. canopy height models based on {LiDAR} data). By enabling the mapping of forest structure and its temporal changes, we believe that {LidarLDA} will be of broad utility to the ecological research community.},

	abstract = {{NASA}’s Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation ({GEDI}) is collecting spaceborne full waveform lidar data with a primary science goal of producing accurate estimates of forest aboveground biomass density ({AGBD}). This paper presents the development of the models used to create {GEDI}’s footprint-level ({\textasciitilde}25 m) {AGBD} ({GEDI}04\_A) product, including a description of the datasets used and the procedure for final model selection. The data used to fit our models are from a compilation of globally distributed spatially and temporally coincident field and airborne lidar datasets, whereby we simulated {GEDI}-like waveforms from airborne lidar to build a calibration database. We used this database to expand the geographic extent of past waveform lidar studies, and divided the globe into four broad strata by Plant Functional Type ({PFT}) and six geographic regions. {GEDI}’s waveform-to-biomass models take the form of parametric Ordinary Least Squares ({OLS}) models with simulated Relative Height ({RH}) metrics as predictor variables. From an exhaustive set of candidate models, we selected the best input predictor variables, and data transformations for each geographic stratum in the {GEDI} domain to produce a set of comprehensive predictive footprint-level models. We found that model selection frequently favored combinations of {RH} metrics at the 98th, 90th, 50th, and 10th height above ground-level percentiles ({RH}98, {RH}90, {RH}50, and {RH}10, respectively), but that inclusion of lower {RH} metrics (e.g. {RH}10) did not markedly improve model performance. Second, forced inclusion of {RH}98 in all models was important and did not degrade model performance, and the best performing models were parsimonious, typically having only 1-3 predictors. Third, stratification by geographic domain ({PFT}, geographic region) improved model performance in comparison to global models without stratification. Fourth, for the vast majority of strata, the best performing models were fit using square root transformation of field {AGBD} and/or height metrics. There was considerable variability in model performance across geographic strata, and areas with sparse training data and/or high {AGBD} values had the poorest performance. These models are used to produce global predictions of {AGBD}, but will be improved in the future as more and better training data become available.},

However, advanced computational skills and specialized knowledge have been normally required to extract forest information from {LiDAR}.The development of accessible tools for 3D forest characterization can facilitate rapid assessment by stakeholders lacking a remote sensing background, thus fostering the practical use of {LiDAR} datasets in forest ecology and conservation. This paper introduces the treetop application, an open-source web-based and R package {LiDAR} analysis tool for extracting forest structural information at the tree level, including cutting-edge analyses of properties related to forest ecology and management.We provide case studies of how treetop can be used for different ecological applications, within various forest ecosystems. Specifically, treetop was employed to assess post-hurricane disturbance in natural temperate forests, forest homogeneity in industrial forest plantations and the spatial distribution of individual trees in a tropical forest.treetop simplifies the extraction of relevant forest information for forest ecologists and conservationists who may use the tool to easily visualize tree positions and sizes, conduct complex analyses and download results including individual tree lists and figures summarizing forest structural properties. Through this open-source approach, treetop can foster the practical use of {LiDAR} data among forest conservation and management stakeholders and help ecological researchers to further understand the relationships between forest structure and function.},

	abstract = {Tropical forests play a significant role in regulating the average global atmospheric temperature encompassing 25 \% of the carbon present in the terrestrial biosphere. However, the rapid change in climate, arising from unsustainable human practices, can significantly affect their carbon uptake capability in the future. For understanding these deviations, it is important to identify and quantify the large-scale canopy height variations arising from previous anthropogenic disturbances. With the advent of {NASA} {GEDI} spaceborne {LiDAR} (light detection and ranging), it is now possible to acquire three-dimensional vertical structural data of forests globally. In this study, we evaluate the applicability of {GEDI} for analyzing relative canopy height variations of secondary tropical forests of different age groups located across multiple geographical regions of peninsular Malaysia. The results for {RH}98 {GEDI} metric trends for the lowland and hill forests category across 4 different disturbance groups show a positive correlation between mean relative height and secondary forest ages. The consistency of these findings with previous studies in the region indicate the usefulness of {GEDI} to provide valuable insights into the patterns and drivers of forest height variation. Thus, this study contributes toward the operationalization of spaceborne {LiDAR} technology for monitoring forest disturbances and measuring biomass recovery rates and should help support large-scale sustainable forest management initiatives with respect to the tropical forests of Malaysia.},

	abstract = {Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation ({GEDI}) satellite mission is expanding the spatial bounds and temporal resolution of large-scale mapping applications. Integrating the recent {GEDI} data into Airborne Laser Scanning ({ALS})-derived estimations represents a global opportunity to update and extend forest models based on area based approaches ({ABA}) considering temporal and spatial dynamics. This study evaluates the effect of combining {ALS}-based aboveground biomass ({AGB}) estimates with {GEDI}-derived models by using temporally coincident datasets. A gradient of forest ecosystems, distributed through 21,766 km2 in the province of Badajoz (Spain), with different species and structural complexity, was used to: (i) assess the accuracy of {GEDI} canopy height in five Mediterranean Ecosystems and (ii) develop {GEDI}-based {AGB} models when using {ALS}-derived {AGB} estimates at {GEDI} footprint level. In terms of Pearson’s correlation (r) and {rRMSE}, the agreement between {ALS} and {GEDI} statistics on canopy height was stronger in the denser and homogeneous coniferous forest of P. pinaster and P. pinea than in sparse Quercus-dominated forests. The {GEDI}-derived {AGB} models using relative height and vertical canopy metrics yielded a model efficiency (Mef) ranging from 0.31 to 0.46, with a {RMSE} ranging from 14.13 to 32.16 Mg/ha and {rRMSE} from 38.17 to 84.74\%, at {GEDI} footprint level by forest type. The impact of forest structure confirmed previous studies achievements, since {GEDI} data showed higher uncertainty in highly multilayered forests. In general, {GEDI}-derived models ({GEDI}-like Level4A) underestimated {AGB} over lower and higher {ALS}-derived {AGB} intervals. The proposed models could also be used to monitor biomass stocks at large-scale by using {GEDI} footprint level in Mediterranean areas, especially in remote and hard-to-reach areas for forest inventory. The findings from this study serve to provide an initial evaluation of {GEDI} data for estimating {AGB} in Mediterranean forest.},

Machine learning techniques have the potential to solve this problem of modeling forest attributes from remotely sensed data. This work tests four different machine learning approaches - namely Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks, and Extreme Gradient Boosting - on high-density {GatorEye} {UAV}-Lidar point clouds for indirect estimation of individual tree dendrometric metrics (field-derived) such as diameter at breast height, total height, and timber volume. A total of 370 trees had their dbh and height measured for validation purposes. Using {LAStools} we generated normalized Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) point clouds and created a raster canopy height model at a 0.5x0.5 m spatial resolution following the construction of a digital terrain model and a digital surface model. The R package ‘{lidR}’ was set with the functions tree\_detection (local maximum filter algorithm) and lastrees. Subsequently, we applied the function tree\_metrics to extract individual metrics. Machine learning techniques were applied to the derived metrics to estimate dendrometric field measures. The machine learning models ({MLM}) with optimal hyperparameters showed similar predictive performances for modeling the variables diameter, height, and volume. All models had a {rRMSE} below 15\% (for diameter at breast height), 9\% (for height) and 29\% (for volume). The Support Vector Regression algorithm showed the best performance. Our work demonstrates that all tested machine learning models are adequate and robust to handle the high dimensionality of {UAV}-Lidar data for the estimation of individual attributes, with Support Vector Regression model being the best performer in terms of minimal error rates.},

In this study, we present a multi-sensor data fusion approach leveraging the strength of each mission to produce wall-to-wall {AGB} maps that are more accurate and spatially comprehensive than what is achievable with any one sensor alone. Specifically, we calibrate a regional L-band radar {AGB} model using the sparse, simulated spaceborne lidar {AGB} estimates. We assess our data fusion framework using simulations of {GEDI}, {ICESat}-2 and {NISAR} data from airborne laser scanning ({ALS}) and {UAVSAR} data acquired over the temperate high {AGB} forest and complex terrain in Sonoma County, California, {USA}. For {ICESat}-2 and {GEDI} missions, we simulate two years of data coverage and {AGB} at footprint level are estimated using realistic {AGB} models. We compare the performance of our fusion framework when different combinations of the sparse simulated {GEDI} and {ICEsat}-2 {AGB} estimates are used to calibrate our regional L-band {AGB} models. In addition, we test our framework at Sonoma using (a) 1-ha square grid cells and (b) similarly sized irregularly shaped objects. We demonstrate that the estimated mean {AGB} across Sonoma is more accurately estimated using our fusion framework than using {GEDI} or {ICESat}-2 mission data alone, either with a regular grid or with irregular segments as mapping units. This research highlights methodological opportunities for fusing new and upcoming active remote sensing data streams toward improved {AGB} mapping through data fusion.},

Classification and Regression Tree ({CART}) analyses were used to compare and contrast the enhancements and accuracy of the multi-sensor urban land cover classifications. Eight urban land-cover classes were developed for the city of Tucson, Arizona, {USA}. These land cover classes focus on pervious and impervious surfaces and microclimate landscape attributes that impact mosquito habitat such as water ponds, residential structures, irrigated lawns, shrubs and trees, shade, and humidity. Results show that synergistic use of {LiDAR}, multispectral and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data produced the most accurate urban land cover classification with a Kappa value of 0.88. Fusion of multi-sensor data leads to a better land cover product that is suitable for a variety of urban applications such as exploring the relationship between neighborhood composition and adult mosquito abundance data to inform public health issues.},

Here we describe the current algorithm theoretical basis for the L4A footprint above ground biomass data product. The L4A data product is above ground biomass density ({AGBD}, Mg · ha-1) at the scale of individual {GEDI} footprints (25 m diameter). Footprint {AGBD} is derived from statistical models that relate waveform height metrics to field-estimated above ground biomass. The field estimates are from long-term permanent plot inventories in which all free-standing woody plants greater than a diameter size threshold have been identified and mapped. We simulated {GEDI} waveforms from discrete-return airborne lidar data using the {GEDI} waveform simulator. We associated height metrics from simulated waveforms with field-estimated {AGBD} at 61 sites in temperate and tropical regions of North and South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. We evaluated the ability of empirical and physically-based regression and machine learning models to predict {AGBD} at the footprint level. Our analysis benchmarks the performance of these models in terms of site and region-specific accuracy and transferability using a globally comprehensive calibration and validation dataset.},

	abstract = {Forest biomass monitoring is at the core of the research agenda due to the critical importance of forest dynamics in the carbon cycle. However, forest biomass is never directly measured; thus, upscaling it from trees to stand or larger scales (e.g., countries, regions) relies on a series of statistical models that may propagate large errors. Here, we review the main steps usually adopted in forest aboveground biomass mapping, highlighting the major challenges and perspectives. We show that there is room for improvement along the scaling-up chain from field data collection to satellite-based large-scale mapping, which should lead to the adoption of effective practices to better control the propagation of errors. We specifically illustrate how the increasing use of emerging technologies to collect massive amounts of high-quality data may significantly improve the accuracy of forest carbon maps. Furthermore, we discuss how sources of spatially structured biases that directly propagate into remote sensing models need to be better identified and accounted for when extrapolating forest carbon estimates, e.g., through a stratification design. We finally discuss the increasing realism of 3D simulated stands, which, through radiative transfer modelling, may contribute to a better understanding of remote sensing signals and open avenues for the direct calibration of large-scale products, thereby circumventing several current difficulties.},

	abstract = {The worldwide variation in vegetation height is fundamental to the global carbon cycle and central to the functioning of ecosystems and their biodiversity. Geospatially explicit and, ideally, highly resolved information is required to manage terrestrial ecosystems, mitigate climate change, and prevent biodiversity loss. Here, we present the first global, wall-to-wall canopy height map at 10 m ground sampling distance for the year 2020. No single data source meets these requirements: dedicated space missions like {GEDI} deliver sparse height data, with unprecedented coverage, whereas optical satellite images like Sentinel-2 offer dense observations globally, but cannot directly measure vertical structures. By fusing {GEDI} with Sentinel-2, we have developed a probabilistic deep learning model to retrieve canopy height from Sentinel-2 images anywhere on Earth, and to quantify the uncertainty in these estimates. The presented approach reduces the saturation effect commonly encountered when estimating canopy height from satellite images, allowing to resolve tall canopies with likely high carbon stocks. According to our map, only 5\% of the global landmass is covered by trees taller than 30 m. Such data play an important role for conservation, e.g., we find that only 34\% of these tall canopies are located within protected areas. Our model enables consistent, uncertainty-informed worldwide mapping and supports an ongoing monitoring to detect change and inform decision making. The approach can serve ongoing efforts in forest conservation, and has the potential to foster advances in climate, carbon, and biodiversity modelling.},

The ecosystem structure and ecosystem function {EBV} classes, which capture the biological effects of disturbance as well as habitat structure, are shown by an expert review process to be the most relevant, feasible, accurate and mature for direct monitoring of biodiversity from satellites. Biodiversity products that require satellite remote sensing of a finer resolution that is still under development are given lower priority (for example, for the {EBV} class species traits). Some {EBVs} are not directly measurable by remote sensing from space, specifically the {EBV} class genetic composition.

	abstract = {Wildfires are becoming larger and more severe due to climate change and historical fire suppression. Technology to quantify ladder fuels, which bridge the gap between the surface and the canopy, can help manage forest structure to reduce fire hazard. In this study we evaluated several remote sensing techniques and field measurements to quantify ladder fuels and relate these metrics to burn severity. Ladder fuel data at 1-m strata from 1-8 m were collected using a 4 x 0.5-m photo banner, a terrestrial laser scanner ({TLS}), a handheld-mobile laser scanner ({HMLS}), an unoccupied aerial system with multispectral camera and Structure from Motion processing ({UAS}-{SfM}), and airborne laser scanner ({ALS}) data in 35 plots in oak woodlands and mixed-conifer forests in Sonoma County, California, {USA}, before wildfires occurred. Canopy base height ({CBH}) was also measured and post-wildfire burn severity was calculated using relativized delta normalized burn ratio ({RdNBR}). The linear relationships among ladder fuel metrics at each strata were compared and {RdNBR} prediction was evaluated with and without {CBH} as an interaction term. All approaches quantified ladder fuels across plots but were not consistently related to each other, unless {CBH} height class was included as a means of categorizing structural differences among plots. The {UAS}-{SfM} could not measure relative differences across plots due to lack of penetration to the ground. Ladder fuels between 1-2m and 2-3m best predicted {RdNBR} across most methods, where {HMLS} had the strongest correlation (R2 = +0.72). By accounting for interactions between ladder fuels from 1-3 m, {CBH}, and burn severity, diverse remote sensing approaches can be used to estimate and validate ladder fuels. Importantly, forest structure has important implications for estimating ladder fuels and may be crucial to consider if ladder fuels are extrapolated across larger spatial scales.},

	abstract = {Obtaining accurate and widespread measurements of the vertical structure of the Earth’s forests has been a long-sought goal for the ecological community. Such observations are critical for accurately assessing the existing biomass of forests, and how changes in this biomass caused by human activities or variations in climate may impact atmospheric {CO}2 concentrations. Additionally, the three-dimensional structure of forests is a key component of habitat quality and biodiversity at local to regional scales. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation ({GEDI}) was launched to the International Space Station in late 2018 to provide high-quality measurements of forest vertical structure in temperate and tropical forests between 51.6° N \& S latitude. The {GEDI} instrument is a geodetic-class laser altimeter/waveform lidar comprised of 3 lasers that produce 8 transects of structural information. Over its two-year nominal lifetime {GEDI} is anticipated to provide over 10 billion waveforms at a footprint resolution of 25 ​m. These data will be used to derive a variety of footprint and gridded products, including canopy height, canopy foliar profiles, Leaf Area Index ({LAI}), sub-canopy topography and biomass. Additionally, data from {GEDI} are used to demonstrate the efficacy of its measurements for prognostic ecosystem modeling, habit and biodiversity studies, and for fusion using radar and other remote sensing instruments. {GEDI} science and technology are unique: no other space-based mission has been created that is specifically optimized for retrieving vegetation vertical structure. As such, {GEDI} promises to advance our understanding of the importance of canopy vertical variations within an ecological paradigm based on structure, composition and function.},

Yet to make full use of these data for quantifying forest carbon stocks and dynamics, a new generation of allometric tools which have tree height and crown size at their centre are needed. Here, we compile a global database of 108753 trees for which stem diameter, height and crown diameter have all been measured, including 2395 trees harvested to measure aboveground biomass. Using this database, we develop general allometric models for estimating both the diameter and aboveground biomass of trees from attributes which can be remotely sensed – specifically height and crown diameter. We show that tree height and crown diameter jointly quantify the aboveground biomass of individual trees and find that a single equation predicts stem diameter from these two variables across the world's forests. These new allometric models provide an intuitive way of integrating remote sensing imagery into large-scale forest monitoring programmes and will be of key importance for parameterizing the next generation of dynamic vegetation models.},

Airborne laser scanning ({ALS}) data sets are increasingly recognized as outstanding data sources for high-fidelity mapping of carbon stocks at regional scales. We develop a tree-centric approach to carbon mapping, based on identifying individual tree crowns ({ITCs}) and species from airborne remote sensing data, from which individual tree carbon stocks are calculated. We identify {ITCs} from the laser scanning point cloud using a region-growing algorithm and identifying species from airborne hyperspectral data by machine learning. For each detected tree, we predict stem diameter from its height and crown-width estimate. From that point on, we use well-established approaches developed for field-based inventories: above-ground biomasses of trees are estimated using published allometries and summed within plots to estimate carbon density. We show this approach is highly reliable: tests in the Italian Alps demonstrated a close relationship between field- and {ALS}-based estimates of carbon stocks (r2 = 0·98). Small trees are invisible from the air, and a correction factor is required to accommodate this effect. An advantage of the tree-centric approach over existing area-based methods is that it can produce maps at any scale and is fundamentally based on field-based inventory methods, making it intuitive and transparent. Airborne laser scanning, hyperspectral sensing and computational power are all advancing rapidly, making it increasingly feasible to use {ITC} approaches for effective mapping of forest carbon density also inside wider carbon mapping programs like {REDD}++.},

Here we review a range of methods available to estimate national-level forest carbon stocks in developing countries. While there are no practical methods to directly measure all forest carbon stocks across a country, both ground-based and remote-sensing measurements of forest attributes can be converted into estimates of national carbon stocks using allometric relationships. Here we synthesize, map and update prominent forest biomass carbon databases to create the first complete set of national-level forest carbon stock estimates. These forest carbon estimates expand on the default values recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Guidelines and provide a range of globally consistent estimates.},

Thus, global monitoring initiatives, such as assessment of essential biodiversity variables ({EBVs}), will necessarily have to involve the combination of disparate data sets. We propose a standardized framework of ecosystem morphological traits – height, cover, and structural complexity – that could enable monitoring of globally consistent {EBVs} at regional scales, by flexibly integrating different information sources – satellites, aircrafts, drones, or ground data – allowing global biodiversity targets relating to ecosystem structure to be monitored and regularly reported.},

In Switzerland, reference heights were taken from an existing canopy height model derived via photogrammetric surface reconstruction.

Our work demonstrates that, given a moderate amount of reference data (i.e., 2000 km2 in Gabon and ≈5800 km2 in Switzerland), high-resolution vegetation height maps with 10 m ground sampling distance ({GSD}) can be derived at country scale from Sentinel-2 imagery.},

While traditional in situ or aerial campaigns for forest assessments provide accurate data for analysis at regional level, scaling them to entire countries and beyond with high temporal resolution is hardly possible. In this work, we propose a Bayesian deep learning approach to densely estimate forest structure variables at country-scale with 10-meter resolution, using freely available satellite imagery as input. Our method jointly transforms Sentinel-2 optical images and Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar images into maps of five different forest structure variables: 95th height percentile, mean height, density, Gini coefficient, and fractional cover. We train and test our model on reference data from 41 airborne laser scanning missions across Norway and demonstrate that it is able to generalize to unseen test regions, achieving normalized mean absolute errors between 11\% and 15\%, depending on the variable. Our work is also the first to propose a Bayesian deep learning approach so as to predict forest structure variables with well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. These increase the trustworthiness of the model and its suitability for downstream tasks that require reliable confidence estimates, such as informed decision making. We present an extensive set of experiments to validate the accuracy of the predicted maps as well as the quality of the predicted uncertainties. To demonstrate scalability, we provide Norway-wide maps for the five forest structure variables.},

The next step will be a hybrid modelling approach, coupling physical process models with the versatility of data-driven machine learning.},

The entire land of China was divided into seven zones according to the geographic characteristics of the forests. The forest {AGB} prediction models were separately developed for different forest types in each of the seven forest zones at {GLAS} footprint level from {GLAS} waveform parameters and biomass derived from height and diameter at breast height ({DBH}) field observation. Some waveform parameters used in the prediction models were able to reduce the effects of slope on biomass estimation. The models of {GLAS}-based biomass estimates were developed by using {GLAS} footprints with slopes less than 20° and slopes ≥ 20°, respectively. Then, all {GLAS} footprint biomass and {MODIS} data were used to establish Random Forest regression models for extrapolating footprint {AGB} to a nationwide scale. The total amount of estimated {AGB} in Chinese forests around 2006 was about 12,622 Mt vs. 12,617 Mt derived from the seventh national forest resource inventory data. Nearly half of all provinces showed a relative error (\%) of less than 20\%, and 80\% of total provinces had relative errors less than 50\%.},

	abstract = {Light detection and ranging (lidar) data provide accurate measurements of forest canopy structure in the vertical plane; however, current lidar sensors have limited coverage in the horizontal plane. Landsat data provide extensive coverage of generalized forest structural classes in the horizontal plane but are relatively insensitive to variation in forest canopy height. It would, therefore, be desirable to integrate lidar and Landsat data to improve the measurement, mapping, and monitoring of forest structural attributes. We tested five aspatial and spatial methods for predicting canopy height, using an airborne lidar system (Aeroscan) and Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper ({ETM}+) data: regression, kriging, cokriging, and kriging and cokriging of regression residuals. Our 200-km2 study area in western Oregon encompassed Oregon State University's {McDonald}–Dunn Research Forest, which is broadly representative of the age and structural classes common in the region. We sampled a spatially continuous lidar coverage in eight systematic patterns to determine which lidar sampling strategy would optimize lidar–Landsat integration in western Oregon forests: transects sampled at 2000, 1000, 500, and 250 m frequencies, and points sampled at these same spatial frequencies. The aspatial regression model results, regardless of sampling strategy, preserved actual vegetation pattern, but underestimated taller canopies and overestimated shorter canopies. The spatial models, kriging and cokriging, produced less biased results than regression but poorly reproduced vegetation pattern, especially at the sparser (2000 and 1000 m) sampling frequencies. The spatial model predictions were more accurate than the regression model predictions at locations {\textless}200 m from sample locations. Cokriging, using the {ETM}+ panchromatic band as the secondary variable, proved slightly more accurate than kriging. The integrated models that kriged or cokriged regression residuals were preferable to either the aspatial or spatial models alone because they preserved the vegetation pattern like regression yet improved estimation accuracies above those predicted from the regression models alone. The 250-m point sampling strategy proved most optimal because it oversampled the landscape relative to the geostatistical range of actual spatial variation, as indicated by the sample semivariograms, while making the sample data volume more manageable. We concluded that an integrated modeling strategy is most suitable for estimating and mapping canopy height at locations unsampled by lidar, and that a 250-m discrete point sampling strategy most efficiently samples an intensively managed forested landscape in western Oregon.},

Early work ,on this problem,used a combination ,of waveform ,height indices and slope indices from a digital elevation model ({DEM}). A second ,generation algorithm was developed,using datasets from diverse forests in which forest canopy height has been estimated in the field or by via airborne lidar. Forest types considered in this paper include evergreen needleleaf, deciduous broadleaf and mixed stands in temperate North America, and tropical evergreen broadleaf forests in Brazil.

	abstract = {Spatially and temporally consistent vegetation structure time-series have great potential to improve the capacity for national land cover monitoring, to reduce latency and cost of international reporting, and to harmonize regional land cover characterizations. Here we present a semi-automatic, operational algorithm for mapping and monitoring of woody vegetation canopy cover and height at a regional scale using freely available Landsat time-series data. The presented algorithm employs automatic data processing and mapping using a set of lidar-based vegetation structure prediction models. Changes in vegetation cover are detected separately and integrated into the structure time-series. Sample-based validation and inter-comparison with existing datasets demonstrates the spatial and temporal consistency of our regional data time-series. The dataset reliably reflects changes in tree cover (tree cover loss user's accuracy of 0.84 and producer's accuracy of 0.75) and can serve as a tool to map annual forest extent (user's accuracy of 0.98 and producer's accuracy of 0.81 for 10\% canopy cover threshold to define the forest class). The tree height estimates are consistent with a {GLAS}-based global map (mean average error of 3.7 m, the correlation coefficient of 0.92 and the R2 of 0.85). The algorithm was prototyped within the Lower Mekong region where it revealed an intensive woody vegetation dynamic. Of the year 2000 forest area (defined using canopy cover threshold of 10\% and tree height threshold of 5 m), 9.4\% was deforested by the year 2017, and 16.6\% was affected by stand-replacement disturbance followed by reforestation. The average annual area of stand-level forest disturbance within the region was 2.34 Mha, and increased by 34\% from 2001 (1.85 Mha) to 2017 (2.48 Mha). Total forest area decreased by 6.2\% within the region, and 11.1\% of year 2000 primary forest area was lost by 2017. At the national level, Cambodia demonstrated the highest rate of deforestation, with a net forest area loss of 22.5\%. We estimated that 21.3\% of 2017 forest cover had an age of 17 years or less, illustrating the intensive forest land uses within the region. The time-series product is suitable for mapping annual land cover and inter-annual land cover change using customized class definitions. The regionally-consistent data are publicly available for download (https://glad.umd.edu/), and online analysis (https://rlcms-servir.adpc.net/en/forest-monitor/), and serve as an input to the {SERVIR}-Mekong Regional Land Cover Monitoring System.},

	abstract = {Passive optical remotely sensed images such as those from the Landsat satellites enable the development of spatially comprehensive, well-calibrated reflectance measures that support large-area mapping. In recent years, as an alternative to field plot data, the use of Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) acquisitions for calibration and validation purposes in combination with such satellite reflectance data to model a range of forest structural response variables has become well established. In this research, we use a predictive modeling approach to map forest structural attributes over the {\textasciitilde}552millionha boreal forest of Canada. For model calibration and independent validation we utilize airborne lidar-derived measurements of forest vertical structure (known as lidar plots) obtained in 2010 via a {\textgreater}25,000km transect-based national survey. Models were developed linking the lidar plot structural variables to wall-to-wall 30-m spatial resolution surface reflectance composites derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus imagery. Spectral indices extracted from the composites, disturbance information (years since disturbance and type), as well as geographic position and topographic variables (i.e., elevation, slope, radiation, etc.) were considered as predictor variables. A nearest neighbor imputation approach based on the Random Forest framework was used to predict a total of 10 forest structural attributes. The model was developed and validated on {\textgreater}80,000 lidar plots, with R2 values ranging from 0.49 to 0.61 for key response variables such as canopy cover, stand height, basal area, stem volume, and aboveground biomass. Additionally, a predictor variable importance analysis confirmed that spectral indices, elevation, and geographic coordinates were key sources of information, ultimately offering an improved understanding of the driving variables for large-area forest structure modeling. This study demonstrates the integration of airborne lidar and Landsat-derived reflectance products to generate detailed and spatially extensive maps of forest structure. The methods are portable to map other attributes of interest (based upon calibration data) through access to Landsat or other appropriate optical remotely-sensed data sources, thereby offering unique opportunities for science, monitoring, and reporting programs.},

The study has tested five allometric models which were developed from pantropical regions, subtropical areas and locally. The best model was then selected as the dependent variable to develop the {LiDAR}-derived {AGB} model. The raw {LiDAR} point cloud was pre-processed to normalized height point cloud and hence generating the {LiDAR} metric as independent variables for the model development. Regression models were used to estimate {AGB} at various plot sizes (i.e., in 10-m, 5-m and 2.5-m radius). The models were then evaluated statistically and validated by bootstrapping and leave-one-out cross validation ({LOOCV}). The results indicated the {LiDAR} metric derived from larger plot size outperformed the smaller plot size, with model R2 of 0.864 and root-mean-square-error ({RMSE}) of 37.75 kg/ha. It also found that pantropical model was comparable to a site-specific model when including the bioclimatic variable in subtropical forests.

	abstract = {Remote sensing-based methods of aboveground biomass ({AGB}) estimation in forest ecosystems have gained increased attention, and substantial research has been conducted in the past three decades. This paper provides a survey of current biomass estimation methods using remote sensing data and discusses four critical issues – collection of field-based biomass reference data, extraction and selection of suitable variables from remote sensing data, identification of proper algorithms to develop biomass estimation models, and uncertainty analysis to refine the estimation procedure. Additionally, we discuss the impacts of scales on biomass estimation performance and describe a general biomass estimation procedure. Although optical sensor and radar data have been primary sources for {AGB} estimation, data saturation is an important factor resulting in estimation uncertainty. {LIght} Detection and Ranging (lidar) can remove data saturation, but limited availability of lidar data prevents its extensive application. This literature survey has indicated the limitations of using single-sensor data for biomass estimation and the importance of integrating multi-sensor/scale remote sensing data to produce accurate estimates over large areas. More research is needed to extract a vertical vegetation structure (e.g. canopy height) from interferometry synthetic aperture radar ({InSAR}) or optical stereo images to incorporate it into horizontal structures (e.g. canopy cover) in biomass estimation modeling.},

	abstract = {Tropical forests are a key component of the global carbon cycle, and mapping their carbon density is essential for understanding human influences on climate and for ecosystem-service-based payments for forest protection. Discrete-return airborne laser scanning ({ALS}) is increasingly recognised as a high-quality technology for mapping tropical forest carbon, because it generates 3D point clouds of forest structure from which aboveground carbon density ({ACD}) can be estimated. Area-based models are state of the art when it comes to estimating {ACD} from {ALS} data, but discard tree-level information contained within the {ALS} point cloud. This paper compares area-based and tree-centric models for estimating {ACD} in lowland old-growth forests in Sabah, Malaysia. These forests are challenging to map because of their immense height. We compare the performance of (a) an area-based model developed by Asner and Mascaro (2014), and used primarily in the neotropics hitherto, with (b) a tree-centric approach that uses a new algorithm ({itcSegment}) to locate trees within the {ALS} canopy height model, measures their heights and crown widths, and calculates biomass from these dimensions. We find that Asner and Mascaro's model needed regional calibration, reflecting the distinctive structure of Southeast Asian forests. We also discover that forest basal area is closely related to canopy gap fraction measured by {ALS}, and use this finding to refine Asner and Mascaro's model. Finally, we show that our tree-centric approach is less accurate at estimating {ACD} than the best-performing area-based model ({RMSE} 18\% vs 13\%). Tree-centric modelling is appealing because it is based on summing the biomass of individual trees, but until algorithms can detect understory trees reliably and estimate biomass from crown dimensions precisely, areas-based modelling will remain the method of choice.},

	abstract = {The mangrove forests of northeast Hainan Island are the most species diverse forests in China and consist of the Dongzhai National Nature Reserve and the Qinglan Provincial Nature Reserve. The former reserve is the first Chinese national nature reserve for mangroves and the latter has the most abundant mangrove species in China. However, to date the aboveground ground biomass ({AGB}) of this mangrove region has not been quantified due to the high species diversity and the difficulty of extensive field sampling in mangrove habitat. Although three-dimensional point clouds can capture the forest vertical structure, their application to large areas is hindered by the logistics, costs and data volumes involved. To fill the gap and address this issue, this study proposed a novel upscaling method for mangrove {AGB} estimation using field plots, {UAV}-{LiDAR} strip data and Sentinel-2 imagery (named G∼{LiDAR}∼S2 model) based on a point-line-polygon framework. In this model, the partial-coverage {UAV}-{LiDAR} data were used as a linear bridge to link ground measurements to the wall-to-wall coverage Sentinel-2 data. The results showed that northeast Hainan Island has a total mangrove {AGB} of 312,806.29 Mg with a mean {AGB} of 119.26 Mg ha−1. The results also indicated that at the regional scale, the proposed {UAV}-{LiDAR} linear bridge method (i.e., G∼{LiDAR}∼S2 model) performed better than the traditional approach, which directly relates field plots to Sentinel-2 data (named the G∼S2 model) (R2 = 0.62 {\textgreater} 0.52, {RMSE} = 50.36 Mg ha−1{\textless}56.63 Mg ha−1). Through a trend extrapolation method, this study inferred that the G∼{LiDAR}∼S2 model could decrease the number of field samples required by approximately 37\% in comparison with those required by the G∼S2 model in the study area. Regarding the {UAV}-{LiDAR} sampling intensity, compared with the original number of {LiDAR} plots, 20\% of original linear bridges could produce an acceptable accuracy (R2 = 0.62, {RMSE} = 51.03 Mg ha−1). Consequently, this study presents the first investigation of {AGB} for the mangrove forests on northeast Hainan Island in China and verifies the feasibility of using this mangrove {AGB} upscaling method for diverse mangrove forests.},

	abstract = {Monitoring tropical forests using spaceborne and airborne remote sensing capabilities is important for informing environmental policies and conservation actions. Developing large-scale machine learning estimation models of forest structure is instrumental in bridging the gap between retrospective analysis and near-real-time monitoring. However, most approaches use moderate spatial resolution satellite data with limited capabilities of frequent updating. Here, we take advantage of the high spatial and temporal resolutions of Planet Dove images and aim to automatically estimate top-of-canopy height ({TCH}) for the biologically diverse country of Peru from satellite imagery at 1 ha spatial resolution by building a model that associates Planet Dove textural features with airborne light detection and ranging ({LiDAR}) measurements of {TCH}. We use and modify features derived from Fourier textural ordination ({FOTO}) of Planet Dove images using spectral projection and train a gradient boosted regression for {TCH} estimation. We discuss the technical and scientific challenges involved in the generation of reliable mechanisms for estimating {TCH} from Planet Dove satellite image spectral and textural features. Our developed software toolchain is a robust and generalizable regression model that provides a root mean square error ({RMSE}) of 4.36 m for Peru. This represents a helpful advancement towards better monitoring of tropical forests and improves efforts in reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation ({REDD}+), an important climate change mitigation approach.},

To support more sustainable forest uses, we need to measure and monitor carbon stocks and emissions at high spatial and temporal resolution. We developed the first large-scale very high-resolution map of aboveground carbon stocks and emissions for the country of Peru by combining 6.7 million hectares of airborne {LiDAR} measurements of top-of-canopy height with thousands of Planet Dove satellite images into a random forest machine learning regression workflow, obtaining an R2 of 0.70 and {RMSE} of 25.38 Mg C ha−1 for the nationwide estimation of aboveground carbon density ({ACD}). The diverse ecosystems of Peru harbor 6.928 Pg C, of which only 2.9 Pg C are found in protected areas or their buffers. We found significant carbon emissions between 2012 and 2017 in areas aggressively affected by oil palm and cacao plantations, agricultural and urban expansions or illegal gold mining. Creating such a cost-effective and spatially explicit indicators of aboveground carbon stocks and emissions for tropical countries will serve as a transformative tool to quantify the climate change mitigation services that forests provide.},

To implement the forest moratorium for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, Indonesia’s government requires information on the carbon stored in forests, including intact, degraded, secondary, and peat swamp forests. We developed a hybrid approach of producing a wall-to-wall map of the aboveground biomass ({AGB}) of intact and degraded forests of Kalimantan at 1 ha grid cells by combining field inventory plots, airborne lidar samples, and satellite radar and optical imagery. More than 110 000 ha of lidar data were acquired to systematically capture variations of forest structure and more than 104 field plots to develop lidar-biomass models. The lidar measurements were converted into biomass using models developed for 66 439 ha of drylands and 44 250 ha of wetland forests. By combining the {AGB} map with the national land cover map, we found that 22.3 Mha (106 ha) of forest remain on drylands ranging in biomass from 357.2 ± 12.3 Mgha−1 in relatively intact forests to 134.2 ± 6.1 Mgha−1 in severely degraded forests. The remaining peat swamp forests are heterogeneous in coverage and degradation level, extending over 3.62 Mha and having an average {AGB} of 211.8 ± 12.7 Mgha−1. Emission factors calculated from aboveground biomass only suggest that the carbon storage potential of more than 15 Mha of degraded and secondary dryland forests will be about 1.1 {PgC}.},

Here, we explore the properties of a new lidar-derived index, the large tree canopy area ({LCA}) defined as the area occupied by canopy above a reference height. We hypothesize that this simple measure of forest structure representing the crown area of large canopy trees could consistently explain the landscape variations in forest volume and aboveground biomass ({AGB}) across a range of climate and edaphic conditions. To test this hypothesis, we assembled a unique dataset of high-resolution airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) and ground inventory data in nine undisturbed old-growth Neotropical forests, of which four had plots large enough (1\&thinsp;ha) to calibrate our model. We found that the {LCA} for trees greater than 27\&thinsp;m ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}∼{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;25–30\&thinsp;m) in height and at least 100\&thinsp;m{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} crown size in a unit area (1\&thinsp;ha), explains more than 75\&thinsp;\% of total forest volume variations, irrespective of the forest biogeographic conditions. When weighted by average wood density of the stand, {LCA} can be used as an unbiased estimator of {AGB} across sites ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{R}$^{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}={\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;0.78, {RMSE}\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}={\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;46.02\&thinsp;Mg\&thinsp;ha{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}, bias {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}={\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}−{\textless}/span{\textgreater}0.63\&thinsp;Mg\&thinsp;ha{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−1}}$){\textless}/span{\textgreater}. Unlike other lidar-derived metrics with complex nonlinear relations to biomass, the relationship between {LCA} and {AGB} is linear and remains unique across forest types. A comparison with tree inventories across the study sites indicates that {LCA} correlates best with the crown area (or basal area) of trees with diameter greater than 50\&thinsp;cm. The spatial invariance of the {LCA}–{AGB} relationship across the Neotropics suggests a remarkable regularity of forest structure across the landscape and a new technique for systematic monitoring of large trees for their contribution to {AGB} and changes associated with selective logging, tree mortality and other types of tropical forest disturbance and dynamics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Wet tropical forests of Chocó, along the Pacific Coast of Colombia, are known for their high plant diversity and endemic species. With increasing pressure of degradation and deforestation, these forests have been prioritized for conservation and carbon offset through Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation ({REDD}+) mechanisms. We provide the first regional assessment of forest structure and aboveground biomass using measurements from a combination of ground tree inventories and airborne Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar). More than 80,000 ha of lidar samples were collected based on a stratified random sampling to provide a regionally unbiased quantification of forest structure of Chocó across gradients of vegetation structure, disturbance and elevation. We developed a model to convert measurements of vertical structure of forests into aboveground biomass ({AGB}) for terra firme, wetlands, and mangrove forests. We used the Random Forest machine learning model and a formal uncertainty analysis to map forest height and {AGB} at 1-ha spatial resolution for the entire pacific coastal region using spaceborne data, extending from the coast to higher elevation of Andean forests.
{RESULTS}: Upland Chocó forests have a mean canopy height of 21.8 m and {AGB} of 233.0 Mg/ha, while wetland forests are characterized by a lower height and {AGB} (13.5 m and 117.5 Mg/a). Mangroves have a lower mean height than upland forests (16.5 m), but have a similar {AGB} as upland forests (229.9 Mg/ha) due to their high wood density. Within the terra firme forest class, intact forests have the highest {AGB} (244.3 ± 34.8 Mg/ha) followed by degraded and secondary forests with 212.57 ± 62.40 Mg/ha of biomass. Forest degradation varies in biomass loss from small-scale selective logging and firewood harvesting to large-scale tree removals for gold mining, settlements, and illegal logging. Our findings suggest that the forest degradation has already caused the loss of more than 115 million tons of dry biomass, or 58 million tons of carbon.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our assessment of carbon stocks and forest degradation can be used as a reference for reporting on the state of the Chocó forests to {REDD}+ projects and to encourage restoration efforts through conservation and climate mitigation policies.},

	abstract = {While Landsat has proved to be effective for monitoring many elements of forest condition and change, the platform has well-documented limitations in measuring forest structure, the vertical distribution of the canopy. This is important because structure determines several key ecosystem functions, including: carbon storage; habitat suitability; and timber volume. Canopy structure is directly measured by {LiDAR}, and it should be possible to train Landsat structure models at a highly local scale with the dense, global sample of full waveform {LiDAR} observations collected by {NASA}’s Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation ({GEDI}). Local models are expected to perform better because: (a) such models may take advantage of localized correlations between structure and canopy surface reflectance; and (b) to the extent that models revert to the mean of the calibration data due to a lack of discrimination, local models will revert to a more representative mean. We tested Landsat-based relative height predictions using a new {GEDI} asset on Google Earth Engine, described here. Mean prediction error declined by 23\% and important prediction biases at the extremes of the range of canopy height dropped as model calibration became more local, minimizing forest structure signal saturation commonly associated with Landsat and other passive optical sensors. Our results suggest that Landsat-based maps of structural variables such as height and biomass may substantially benefit from the kind of local calibration that {GEDI}’s dense sample of {LiDAR} data supports.},

	abstract = {The ability to use digital remotely sensed data for forest inventory is often limited by the nature of the measures, which, with the exception of multi-angular or stereo observations, are largely insensitive to vertically distributed attributes. As a result, empirical estimates are typically made to characterize attributes such as height, volume, or biomass, with known asymptotic relationships as signal saturation occurs. Lidar (light detection and ranging) has emerged as a robust means to collect and subsequently characterize vertically distributed attributes. Lidar has been established as an appropriate data source for forest inventory purposes; however, large area monitoring and mapping activities with lidar remain challenging due to the logistics, costs, and data volumes involved. The use of lidar as a sampling tool for large-area estimation may mitigate some or all of these problems. A number of factors drive, and are common to, the use of airborne profiling, airborne scanning, and spaceborne lidar systems as sampling tools for measuring and monitoring forest resources across areas that range in size from tens of thousands to millions of square kilometers. In this communication, we present the case for lidar sampling as a means to enable timely and robust large-area characterizations. We briefly outline the nature of different lidar systems and data, followed by the theoretical and statistical underpinnings for lidar sampling. Current applications are presented and the future potential of using lidar in an integrated sampling framework for large area ecosystem characterization and monitoring is presented. We also include recommendations regarding statistics, lidar sampling schemes, applications (including data integration and stratification), and subsequent information generation.},

	abstract = {To estimate mangrove biomass at finer resolution, such as at an individual tree or clump level, there is a crucial need for elaborate management of mangrove forest in a local area. However, there are few studies estimating mangrove biomass at finer resolution partly due to the limitation of remote sensing data. Using {WorldView}-2 imagery, unmanned aerial vehicle ({UAV}) light detection and ranging ({LiDAR}) data, and field survey datasets, we proposed a novel method for the estimation of mangrove aboveground biomass ({AGB}) at individual tree level, i.e., individual tree-based inference method. The performance of the individual tree-based inference method was compared with the grid-based random forest model method, which directly links the field samples with the {UAV} {LiDAR} metrics. We discussed the feasibility of the individual tree-based inference method and the influence of diameter at breast height ({DBH}) on individual segmentation accuracy. The results indicated that (1) The overall classification accuracy of six mangrove species at individual tree level was 86.08\%. (2) The position and number matching accuracies of individual tree segmentation were 87.43\% and 51.11\%, respectively. The number matching accuracy of individual tree segmentation was relatively satisfying within 8 cm ≤ {DBH} ≤ 30 cm. (3) The individual tree-based inference method produced lower accuracy than the grid-based {RF} model method with R2 of 0.49 vs. 0.67 and {RMSE} of 48.42 Mg ha−1 vs. 38.95 Mg ha−1. However, the individual tree-based inference method can show more detail of spatial distribution of mangrove {AGB}. The resultant {AGB} maps of this method are more beneficial to the fine and differentiated management of mangrove forests.},

	abstract = {The Amazon region in Brazil contains c. 30\% of the palm species of the world. However, palm cover at macroecological scales has not yet been quantified in this biome. Here, we used high spatial resolution {LiDAR} data, acquired from 610 flightlines over the Brazilian Amazon, to map canopy palm cover for the first time using a deep learning approach. The image segmentation model from U‐Net deep learning was selected for mapping palm segments using the {LiDAR} canopy height model ({CHM}) at 0.5‐m spatial resolution. To train and validate the model, we manually delineated 6971 canopy palm segments over 931.43 ha of forests on four training sites by inspecting their unique star‐shaped crown architecture in the {CHM}. The results indicated an accuracy of 80\% to automatically map canopy palm area. The approach detected {\textgreater}1.1 million palm segments over the 480 000 ha sampled by {LiDAR} and roughly estimated 1.05 billion palm segments for the Brazilian Amazon. Palm cover was not evenly distributed over the Amazon, revealing undocumented hotspots of high cover ({\textgreater}5\%) in eastern Amazon (Pará state), and confirming documented hotspots in southwest (Acre state) and north of the region (Roraima state). Palm segment height was strongly and positively correlated with forest height, where palm segments showed overall lower height. A higher canopy palm cover was observed over shorter forests, while the opposite was found over taller forests, where palms may not be visible from the canopy. Palm segments occurred more frequently at valleys but they were also observed in other landscapes, depending on site location and forest height. Our findings highlight the disproportional occurrence of palm cover in some Amazonian canopies. This fact should be taken into account to improve regional carbon cycle representation and promote initiatives of biodiversity conservation and bioeconomic use of these forests. The use of airborne {LiDAR} data and deep learning allowed mapping more than 1.1 million canopy palm segments across 480 000 ha of forests with 80\% accuracy, and roughly estimating 1.05 billion canopy palm segments in the Brazilian Amazon region. We identified a new hotspot of palm‐dominated forests in eastern Amazon (Pará state) in addition to other hotspots previously recognized in southern Amazon states (Acre and Rondônia). Palm height followed the overall forest height, where shorter forests had higher canopy palm cover and taller forests likely obscured palms present in the understory.},

	abstract = {At the abrupt ecotone between the upper limit of southern beech forests in New Zealand and adjacent subalpine vegetation, ecological processes such as competition/facilitation, and species’ tolerances to alpine conditions, maintain a dynamic balance between these two contrasting plant communities. While other treeline ecotones globally have responded to ongoing climatic changes there is little evidence that the position and form of the beech-subalpine ecotone has undergone similar changes over the past decades. Further, it is unknown when the beech forest-subalpine ecotone will respond to such changes in the future. Critical to predicting change is understanding the abiotic and biotic factors that limit recruitment of individual trees above the treeline. To address this, this thesis research aimed to further elucidate the role of subalpine microhabitat variability in controlling forest regeneration patterns in abrupt treeline ecotones.},

	abstract = {We report large-scale estimates of Amazonian gap dynamics using a novel approach with large datasets of airborne light detection and ranging (lidar), including five multi-temporal and 610 single-date lidar datasets. Specifically, we (1) compared the fixed height and relative height methods for gap delineation and established a relationship between static and dynamic gaps (newly created gaps); (2) explored potential environmental/climate drivers explaining gap occurrence using generalized linear models; and (3) cross-related our findings to mortality estimates from 181 field plots. Our findings suggest that static gaps are significantly correlated to dynamic gaps and can inform about structural changes in the forest canopy. Moreover, the relative height outperformed the fixed height method for gap delineation. Well-defined and consistent spatial patterns of dynamic gaps were found over the Amazon, while also revealing the dynamics of areas never sampled in the field. The predominant pattern indicates 20–35\% higher gap dynamics at the west and southeast than at the central-east and north. These estimates were notably consistent with field mortality patterns, but they showed 60\% lower magnitude likely due to the predominant detection of the broken/uprooted mode of death. While topographic predictors did not explain gap occurrence, the water deficit, soil fertility, forest flooding and degradation were key drivers of gap variability at the regional scale. These findings highlight the importance of lidar in providing opportunities for large-scale gap dynamics and tree mortality monitoring over the Amazon.},

	abstract = {Canopy cover is an important forest structure parameter for many applications in ecology, hydrology, and forest management. Light detection and ranging ({LiDAR}) is a promising tool for estimating canopy cover because it can penetrate forest canopy. Various algorithms have been developed to calculate canopy cover from {LiDAR} data. However, little attention was paid to evaluating how different factors, such as estimation algorithm, {LiDAR} point density and scan angle, influence canopy cover estimates; and how {LiDAR}-derived canopy cover differs from estimates using traditional methods, such as field measurements, aerial and satellite imagery. In this study, we systematically compared canopy cover estimations from {LiDAR} data, quick field measurements, aerial imagery, and satellite imagery using different algorithms. The results show that {LiDAR}-derived canopy cover estimates are marginally influenced by the estimation algorithms. {LiDAR} data with a point density of 1 point/m2 can generate comparable canopy cover estimates to data with a higher density. The uncertainty of canopy cover estimates from {LiDAR} data increased drastically as scan angles exceed 12°. Plot-level canopy cover estimates derived from quick field measurements do not have strong correlation with {LiDAR}-derived estimations. Both the aerial imagery-derived and satellite imagery-derived canopy cover estimates are comparable to {LiDAR}-derived canopy cover estimates at the forest stand scale, but tend to be overestimated in sparse forests and be underestimated in dense forests, particularly for the aerial imagery-derived estimates. The results from this study can provide practical guidance for the selection of data sources, sampling schemes, and estimation methods in regional canopy cover mapping.},

	abstract = {Data from spaceborne light detection and ranging (lidar) opens the possibility to map forest vertical structure globally. We present a wall-to-wall, global map of canopy height at 1-km spatial resolution, using 2005 data from the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System ({GLAS}) aboard {ICESat} (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite). A challenge in the use of {GLAS} data for global vegetation studies is the sparse coverage of lidar shots (mean = 121 data points/degree2 for the L3C campaign). However, {GLAS}-derived canopy height ({RH}100) values were highly correlated with other, more spatially dense, ancillary variables available globally, which allowed us to model global {RH}100 from forest type, tree cover, elevation, and climatology maps. The difference between the model predicted {RH}100 and footprint level lidar-derived {RH}100 values showed that error increased in closed broadleaved forests such as the Amazon, underscoring the challenges in mapping tall ({\textgreater}40 m) canopies. The resulting map was validated with field measurements from 66 {FLUXNET} sites. The modeled {RH}100 versus in situ canopy height error ({RMSE} = 6.1 m, R2 = 0.5; or, {RMSE} = 4.4 m, R2 = 0.7 without 7 outliers) is conservative as it also includes measurement uncertainty and sub pixel variability within the 1-km pixels. Our results were compared against a recently published canopy height map. We found our values to be in general taller and more strongly correlated with {FLUXNET} data. Our map reveals a global latitudinal gradient in canopy height, increasing towards the equator, as well as coarse forest disturbance patterns.},

	abstract = {Identifying and characterizing vascular plants in time and space is required in various disciplines, e.g. in forestry, conservation and agriculture. Remote sensing emerged as a key technology revealing both spatial and temporal vegetation patterns. Harnessing the ever growing streams of remote sensing data for the increasing demands on vegetation assessments and monitoring requires efficient, accurate and flexible methods for data analysis. In this respect, the use of deep learning methods is trend-setting, enabling high predictive accuracy, while learning the relevant data features independently in an end-to-end fashion. Very recently, a series of studies have demonstrated that the deep learning method of Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNN}) is very effective to represent spatial patterns enabling to extract a wide array of vegetation properties from remote sensing imagery. This review introduces the principles of {CNN} and distils why they are particularly suitable for vegetation remote sensing. The main part synthesizes current trends and developments, including considerations about spectral resolution, spatial grain, different sensors types, modes of reference data generation, sources of existing reference data, as well as {CNN} approaches and architectures. The literature review showed that {CNN} can be applied to various problems, including the detection of individual plants or the pixel-wise segmentation of vegetation classes, while numerous studies have evinced that {CNN} outperform shallow machine learning methods. Several studies suggest that the ability of {CNN} to exploit spatial patterns particularly facilitates the value of very high spatial resolution data. The modularity in the common deep learning frameworks allows a high flexibility for the adaptation of architectures, whereby especially multi-modal or multi-temporal applications can benefit. An increasing availability of techniques for visualizing features learned by {CNNs} will not only contribute to interpret but to learn from such models and improve our understanding of remotely sensed signals of vegetation. Although {CNN} has not been around for long, it seems obvious that they will usher in a new era of vegetation remote sensing.},

In the field of forestry, field measurements of forest characteristics such as species composition, basal area, and stand density are used to inform and evaluate management activities. Quantifying these metrics accurately across large landscapes in a meaningful way is extremely important to facilitate informed decision-making. In this study, we present a remote sensing based methodology to estimate species composition, basal area and stand tree density for pine and hardwood tree species at the spatial resolution of a Forest Inventory Analysis ({FIA}) program plot (78 m by 70 m). Our methodology uses textural metrics derived at this spatial scale to relate plot summaries of forest characteristics to remotely sensed National Agricultural Imagery Program ({NAIP}) aerial imagery across broad extents. Our findings quantify strong relationships between {NAIP} imagery and {FIA} field data. On average, models of basal area and trees per acre accounted for 43\% of the variation in the {FIA} data, while models identifying species composition had less than 15.2\% error in predicted class probabilities. Moreover, these relationships can be used to spatially characterize the condition of forests at fine spatial resolutions across broad extents.},

	abstract = {In the absence of complete lidar coverage, digital surface models ({DSMs}) and point clouds produced from the United States Department of Agriculture National Agriculture Imagery Program ({NAIP}) are increasingly being analyzed for quality and application feasibility. This study compared canopy heights derived from {NAIP} {DSMs} (10 m) and point clouds to those derived from lidar data collected over Mountain Lake Biological Station and the Great Smoky Mountains Twin Creeks Site by the National Ecological Observatory Network ({NEON}) Airborne Observation Platform for 62 mixed deciduous tree plots. Mean dominant height ({MDH}) was estimated using lidar and the {NAIP} products using the 90th percentile of heights in a given plot as the independent variable for both the lidar- and {NAIP}-derived point clouds. The dependent variable was field-measured {MDH}, calculated using the four tallest trees for each 0.04-hectare plot based on the {NEON} woody vegetation structure dataset. All data (field and remotely sensed) were collected in 2018. Using maximum likelihood spatial error model for all analyses, the {NAIP} {DSM} (10 m resolution) resulted in a strong relationship with {MDH} (coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.90, standard error ({SE}) = 1.71 m). However, the 90th percentiles of heights derived from the point clouds were better at estimating {MDH} than was the comparatively coarse resolution {DSM} ({NAIP} point clouds: R2 = 0.94, {SE} = 1.40 m; lidar: R2 = 0.95, {SE}= 1.29 m, respectively) and are strongly correlated to each other (R2 = 0.99, {SE} = 0.68 m). The main limitation of the {NAIP} datasets was found to be where shadowing occurred due to steep terrain in the Great Smoky Mountain site. These areas resulted in erroneously high vegetation heights. Mean dominant heights estimated using {NAIP} {DSMs} and point clouds are thus comparable to those estimated using lidar data in these closed-canopy temperate deciduous forests where shadowing from steep terrain is not present. The utility of both the {NAIP}-derived 10 m {DSM} and the point clouds for estimating tree heights paves the way for statewide mapping of heights over the deciduous forests in Tennessee, Virginia, and possibly beyond.},
