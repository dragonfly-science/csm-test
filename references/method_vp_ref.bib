	abstract = {Aboveground woody biomass for circa-2000 is mapped at national scale in Uganda at 30-m spatial resolution on the basis of Landsat {ETM}+images, a National land cover dataset and field data using an object-oriented approach. A regression tree-based model (Random Forest) produces good results (cross-validated R² 0.81, {RMSE} 13T/ha) when trained with a sufficient number of field plots representative of the vegetation variability at national scale. The Random Forest model captures non-linear relationships between satellite data and biomass density, and is able to use categorical data (land cover) in the regression to improve the results. Biomass estimates were strongly correlated (r=0.90 and r=0.83) with independent {LiDAR} measurements. In this study, we demonstrate that in certain contexts Landsat data provide the capability to spatialize field biomass measurements and produce accurate and detailed estimates of biomass distribution at national scale. We also investigate limitations of this approach, which tend to provide conservative biomass estimates. Specific limitations are mainly related to saturation of the optical signal at high biomass density and cloud cover, which hinders the compilation of a radiometrically consistent multi-temporal dataset. As a result, a Landsat mosaic created for Uganda with images acquired in the dry season during 1999–2003 does not contain phenological information useful for discriminating some vegetation types, such as deciduous formations. The addition of land cover data increases the model performance because it provides information on vegetation phenology. We note that Landsat data present higher spatial and thematic resolution compared to land cover and allow detailed and spatially continuous biomass estimates to be mapped. Fusion of satellite and ancillary data may improve biomass predictions but, to avoid error propagation, accurate, detailed and up-to-date land cover or other ancillary data are necessary.},

Two new indices ({PSSR} and {PSND}) are developed which have advantages over previous techniques. The optimal individual wavebands for pigment estimation are identified empirically as 680nm for chlorophyll a, 635nm for chlorophyll b and 470nm for the carotenoids. These wavebands are justified theoretically and are shown to improve the performance of many of the spectral indices tested. Strong predictive models are demonstrated for chlorophyll a and b, but not for the carotenoids and the paper explores the reasons for this.},

	abstract = {Burnt forest recovery is normally monitored with a time-series analysis of satellite data because of its proficiency for large observation areas. Traditional methods, such as linear correlation plotting, have been proven to be effective, as forest recovery naturally increases with time. However, these methods are complicated and time consuming when increasing the number of observed parameters. In this work, we present a random forest variable importance ({RF}-{VIMP}) scheme called multilevel {RF}-{VIMP} to compare and assess the relationship between 36 spectral indices (parameters) of burnt boreal forest recovery in the Great Xing\&rsquo;an Mountain, China. Six Landsat images were acquired in the same month 0, 1, 4, 14, 16, and 20 years after a fire, and 39,380 fixed-location samples were then extracted to calculate the effectiveness of the 36 parameters. Consequently, the proposed method was applied to find correlations between the forest recovery indices. The experiment showed that the proposed method is suitable for explaining the efficacy of those spectral indices in terms of discrimination and trend analysis, and for showing the satellite data and forest succession dynamics when applied in a time series. The results suggest that the tasseled cap transformation wetness, brightness, and the shortwave infrared bands (both 1 and 2) perform better than other indices for both classification and monitoring.},

	volume = {35},
	abstract = {This paper contains a strategy for estimating total aboveground biomass of tropical forests. We developed regression equations to estimate aboveground biomass of individual trees as a function of diameter at breast height, total height, wood density, and Holdridge life zone (sensu Holdridge 1967). The regressions are applied to some 5,300 trees from 43 independent sample plots, and 101 stand tables from large-scale forest inventories in four countries, to estimate commercial and total aboveground biomass per unit area by forest type, and to estimate expansion factors defined as the ratio of aboveground to commercial biomass. The quadratic stand diameter ({QSD}, i.e., the diameter of a tree of average basal area) in a given forest stand influences the magnitude of the expansion factor. Stands of small trees have large expansion factors (up to 6.4), and as {QSD} increases, the expansion factor decreases to a constant value (about 1.75). For undisturbed forests in moist, moist transition to dry, and dry life zones respectively, the expansion factors for total aboveground biomass were 1.74, 1.95, and 1.57 respectively. For undisturbed, logged, and nonproductive forest categories used by the {FAO} to report global commercial wood volume data, we estimated expansion factors of 1.75, 1.90, and 2.00 respectively. Applying these factors to {FAO} data results in a 28 to 47\% increase in previous volume-derived estimates of tropical forest biomass. However, estimates of tropical forest biomass based on small destructive samples continue to be high relative to estimates based on volume data. For. Sci. 35(4):881-902.},

	abstract = {The recent launch of the Sentinel-1 ({SAR}) and Sentinel-2 (multispectral) missions offers a new opportunity for land-based biomass mapping and monitoring especially in the tropics where deforestation is highest. Yet, unlike in agriculture and inland land uses, the use of Sentinel imagery has not been evaluated for biomass retrieval in mangrove forest and the non-forest land uses that replaced mangroves. In this study, we evaluated the ability of Sentinel imagery for the retrieval and predictive mapping of above-ground biomass of mangroves and their replacement land uses. We used Sentinel {SAR} and multispectral imagery to develop biomass prediction models through the conventional linear regression and novel Machine Learning algorithms. We developed models each from {SAR} raw polarisation backscatter data, multispectral bands, vegetation indices, and canopy biophysical variables. The results show that the model based on biophysical variable Leaf Area Index ({LAI}) derived from Sentinel-2 was more accurate in predicting the overall above-ground biomass. In contrast, the model which utilised optical bands had the lowest accuracy. However, the {SAR}-based model was more accurate in predicting the biomass in the usually deficient to low vegetation cover non-forest replacement land uses such as abandoned aquaculture pond, cleared mangrove and abandoned salt pond. These models had 0.82–0.83 correlation/agreement of observed and predicted value, and root mean square error of 27.8–28.5 Mg ha−1. Among the Sentinel-2 multispectral bands, the red and red edge bands (bands 4, 5 and 7), combined with elevation data, were the best variable set combination for biomass prediction. The red edge-based Inverted Red-Edge Chlorophyll Index had the highest prediction accuracy among the vegetation indices. Overall, Sentinel-1 {SAR} and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery can provide satisfactory results in the retrieval and predictive mapping of the above-ground biomass of mangroves and the replacement non-forest land uses, especially with the inclusion of elevation data. The study demonstrates encouraging results in biomass mapping of mangroves and other coastal land uses in the tropics using the freely accessible and relatively high-resolution Sentinel imagery.},

The above-ground biomass ({AGB}) acts as reliable source of carbon sink and while Hong Kong has recognized the importance of carbon sink in forest and urged for forest protection in the latest strategic plan, yet no study has been conducted on assessing the baseline of terrestrial {AGB} and its carbon storage. This study compared and estimated the {AGB} by the traditional allometric modeling and the Light Detection and Ranging ({LiDAR}) plot metrics at plot-level in a subtropical forest of Hong Kong. The study has tested five allometric models which were developed from pantropical regions, subtropical areas and locally. The best model was then selected as the dependent variable to develop the {LiDAR}-derived {AGB} model. The raw {LiDAR} point cloud was pre-processed to normalized height point cloud and hence generating the {LiDAR} metric as independent variables for the model development. Regression models were used to estimate {AGB} at various plot sizes (i.e., in 10-m, 5-m and 2.5-m radius). The models were then evaluated statistically and validated by bootstrapping and leave-one-out cross validation ({LOOCV}). The results indicated the {LiDAR} metric derived from larger plot size outperformed the smaller plot size, with model R2 of 0.864 and root-mean-square-error ({RMSE}) of 37.75 kg/ha. It also found that pantropical model was comparable to a site-specific model when including the bioclimatic variable in subtropical forests.

	abstract = {Bamboo forests, due to rapid growth and short harvest rotation, play an important role in carbon cycling and local economic development. Accurate estimation of bamboo forest aboveground biomass ({AGB}) has garnered increasing attention during the past two decades. However, remote sensing-based {AGB} estimation for bamboo forests is challenging due to poor understanding of the mechanisms between bamboo forest growth characteristics and remote sensing data. The objective of this research is to examine the remote sensing characteristics of on-year and off-year bamboo forests at different dates and their {AGB} estimation performance. This research used multiple Sentinel-2 data to explore {AGB} estimation of bamboo forests in Zhejiang Province, China, by taking into account the unique characteristics of on-year and off-year bamboo forest growth features. Combining field survey data and Sentinel-2 spectral responses (spectral bands and vegetation indices) and textural images, random forest was used to identify key variables for {AGB} estimation. The results show that (1) the on-year and off-year bamboo forests have considerably different spectral signatures, especially in the wavelengths between red edge 2 and near-infrared wavelength ({NIR}2) (740\&ndash;865 nm), making it possible to separate on-year and off-year bamboo forests; (2) on-year bamboo forests have similar spectral signatures although {AGB} increases from as small as 40 Mgha\&minus;1 to as high as 90 Mgha\&minus;1, implying that optical sensor data cannot effectively model on-year bamboo {AGB}; (3) off-year bamboo {AGB} has significant relationships with red and shortwave infrared ({SWIR}) spectral bands in the April image and with red edge 2 in the July image, but the {AGB} saturation problem yields poor estimation accuracy; (4) stratification considerably improved off-year bamboo {AGB} estimation but not on-year, non-stratification using the April image is recommended; and (5) Sentinel-2 data cannot solve the bamboo {AGB} data saturation problem when {AGB} is greater than 70 Mgha\&minus;1, similar to other optical sensor data such as Landsat. More research should be conducted in the future to integrate multiple sources\&mdash;remotely sensed data (e.g., lidar, optical sensor data) and ancillary data (e.g., soil, topography)\&mdash;into {AGB} modeling to improve the estimation. The use of very high spatial resolution images that can effectively extract tree density information may improve bamboo {AGB} estimation and yield new insights.},

	abstract = {Forest stand volume is a vital indicator of productivity and carbon storage. Conventionally, stand volume is estimated from field samples, Synthetic Aperture Radar ({SAR}), and optical imagery, which suffer saturation problems. Although Light Detection and Ranging ({LiDAR}) technique degrades the signal saturation, its large-scale application is hindered by spatial continuity. To address this issue, recently released Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation ({GEDI}) {LiDAR} data, Sentinel-1 {SAR}, Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument ({MSI}), and Advanced Land Observing Satellite ({ALOS}) digital surface model ({DSM}) imagery were integrated for volume modeling and estimation under a point-line-polygon framework. The footprint-level {LiDAR} variables, as a linear bridge, were adopted to link field plots to the full-cover multi-sensor imagery. Results showed that volume of the Changbai Mountains Mixed Forests Ecoregion ({CMMFE}) displayed variations along the elevation gradient, ranging from 47.56 to 277.30 m3/ha with a mean value of 151.39 m3/ha. Additionally, the accuracy comparison based on independent validation samples indicated that integrating {GEDI} {LiDAR} data under a point-line-polygon framework performed better than the traditional point-polygon approach, which directly linked field samples to multi-sensor imagery. The corresponding estimated error declined from 22.08\% to 15.21\%. The canopy cover and tree height from {LiDAR}, elevation from L band {InSAR}, and spectral indices of {MSI} red-edge bands were key for stand volume mapping in heterogeneous temperate forests. This comparison also showed that the integration of {LiDAR} by a point-line-polygon framework adopted 2/3 of the modeling points but acquired more accurate estimation than a traditional approach only based on multi-sensor imagery, which implied less field sampling work was needed for similar research. Consequently, as a pioneering exploration of {GEDI} {LiDAR} data combined with multi-sensor imagery under the point-line-polygon framework, this study provides an efficient methodology for the volume estimation of heterogeneous forests.},

	abstract = {Tropical forests are an important component of the global carbon balance, yet there is considerable uncertainty in estimates of their carbon stocks and fluxes, which are typically estimated through analysis of aboveground biomass in field plots. Remote sensing technology is critical for assessing fine-scale spatial variability of tropical forest biomass over broad spatial extents. The goal of our study was to evaluate relatively new technology, small-footprint, discrete-return lidar and hyperspectral sensors, for the estimation of aboveground biomass in a Costa Rican tropical rain forest landscape. We derived a suite of predictive metrics for field plots: lidar metrics were calculated from plot vertical height profiles and hyperspectral metrics included fraction of spectral mixing endmembers and narrowband indices that respond to photosynthetic vegetation, structure, senescence, health and water and lignin content. We used single- and two-variable linear regression analyses to relate lidar and hyperspectral metrics to aboveground biomass of plantation, managed parkland and old-growth forest plots. The best model using all 83 biomass plots included two lidar metrics, plot-level mean height and maximum height, with an r2 of 0.90 and root-mean-square error ({RMSE}) of 38.3Mg/ha. When the analysis was constrained to plantation plots, which had the most accurate field data, the r2 of the model increased to 0.96, with {RMSE} of 10.8Mg/ha (n=32). Hyperspectral metrics provided lower accuracy in estimating biomass than lidar metrics, and models with a single lidar and hyperspectral metric were no better than the best model using two lidar metrics. These results should be viewed as an initial assessment of using these combined sensors to estimate tropical forest biomass; hyperspectral data were reduced to nine indices and three spectral mixture fractions, lidar data were limited to first-return canopy height, sensors were flown only once at different seasons, and we explored only linear regression for modeling. However, this study does support conclusions from studies at this and other climate zones that lidar is a premier instrument for mapping biomass (i.e., carbon stocks) across broad spatial scales.},

	abstract = {Tropical forests are a key component of the global carbon cycle, and mapping their carbon density is essential for understanding human influences on climate and for ecosystem-service-based payments for forest protection. Discrete-return airborne laser scanning ({ALS}) is increasingly recognised as a high-quality technology for mapping tropical forest carbon, because it generates 3D point clouds of forest structure from which aboveground carbon density ({ACD}) can be estimated. Area-based models are state of the art when it comes to estimating {ACD} from {ALS} data, but discard tree-level information contained within the {ALS} point cloud. This paper compares area-based and tree-centric models for estimating {ACD} in lowland old-growth forests in Sabah, Malaysia. These forests are challenging to map because of their immense height. We compare the performance of (a) an area-based model developed by Asner and Mascaro (2014), and used primarily in the neotropics hitherto, with (b) a tree-centric approach that uses a new algorithm ({itcSegment}) to locate trees within the {ALS} canopy height model, measures their heights and crown widths, and calculates biomass from these dimensions. We find that Asner and Mascaro's model needed regional calibration, reflecting the distinctive structure of Southeast Asian forests. We also discover that forest basal area is closely related to canopy gap fraction measured by {ALS}, and use this finding to refine Asner and Mascaro's model. Finally, we show that our tree-centric approach is less accurate at estimating {ACD} than the best-performing area-based model ({RMSE} 18\% vs 13\%). Tree-centric modelling is appealing because it is based on summing the biomass of individual trees, but until algorithms can detect understory trees reliably and estimate biomass from crown dimensions precisely, areas-based modelling will remain the method of choice.},

	abstract = {The long wavelength edge of the major chlorophyll absorption feature in the spectrum of a vegetation canopy moves to longer wavelengths with an increase in chlorophyll content. The position of this red-edge has been used successfully to estimate, by remote sensing, the chlorophyll content of vegetation canopies. Techniques used to estimate this red-edge position ({REP}) have been designed for use on small volumes of continuous spectral data rather than the large volumes of discontinuous spectral data recorded by contemporary satellite spectrometers. Also, each technique produces a different value of {REP} from the same spectral data and {REP} values are relatively insensitive to chlorophyll content at high values of chlorophyll content. This paper reports on the design and indirect evaluation of a surrogate {REP} index for use with spectral data recorded at the standard band settings of the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer ({MERIS}). This index, termed the {MERIS} terrestrial chlorophyll index ({MTCI}), was evaluated using model spectra, field spectra and {MERIS} data. It was easy to calculate (and so can be automated), was correlated strongly with {REP} but unlike {REP} was sensitive to high values of chlorophyll content. As a result this index became an official {MERIS} level-2 product of the European Space Agency in March 2004. Further direct evaluation of the {MTCI} is proposed, using both greenhouse and field data.},

	abstract = {Farmers must balance the competing goals of supplying adequate N for their crops while minimizing N losses to the environment. To characterize the spatial variability of N over large fields, traditional methods (soil testing, plant tissue analysis, and chlorophyll meters) require many point samples. Because of the close link between leaf chlorophyll and leaf N concentration, remote sensing techniques have the potential to evaluate the N variability over large fields quickly. Our objectives were to (1) select wavelengths sensitive to leaf chlorophyll concentration, (2) simulate canopy reflectance using a radiative transfer model, and (3) propose a strategy for detecting leaf chlorophyll status of plants using remotely sensed data. A wide range of leaf chlorophyll levels was established in field-grown corn (Zea mays L.) with the application of 8 N levels: 0\%, 12.5\%, 25\%, 50\%, 75\%, 100\%, 125\%, and 150\% of the recommended rate. Reflectance and transmittance spectra of fully expanded upper leaves were acquired over the 400-nm to 1,000-nm wavelength range shortly after anthesis with a spectroradiometer and integrating sphere. Broad-band differences in leaf spectra were observed near 550 nm, 715 nm, and {\textgreater}750 nm. Crop canopy reflectance was simulated using the {SAIL} (Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves) canopy reflectance model for a wide range of background reflectances, leaf area indices ({LAI}), and leaf chlorophyll concentrations. Variations in background reflectance and {LAI} confounded the detection of the relatively subtle differences in canopy reflectance due to changes in leaf chlorophyll concentration. Spectral vegetation indices that combined near-infrared reflectance and red reflectance (e.g., {OSAVI} and {NIR}/Red) minimized contributions of background reflectance, while spectral vegetation indices that combined reflectances of near-infrared and other visible bands ({MCARI} and {NIR}/Green) were responsive to both leaf chlorophyll concentrations and background reflectance. Pairs of these spectral vegetation indices plotted together produced isolines of leaf chlorophyll concentrations. The slopes of these isolines were linearly related to leaf chlorophyll concentration. A limited test with measured canopy reflectance and leaf chlorophyll data confirmed these results. The characterization of leaf chlorophyll concentrations at the field scale without the confounding problem of background reflectance and {LAI} variability holds promise as a valuable aid for decision making in managing N applications.},

Previous studies indicate that geometric features have a strong impact on land cover classification. Here, we analyzed an urban {LiDAR} dataset to explore the optimal feature subset from 25 geometric features incorporating 25 scales under 6 definitions for urban land cover classification. We performed a feature selection strategy to remove irrelevant or redundant features based on the correlation coefficient between features and classification accuracy of each features. The neighborhood scales were divided into small (0.5–1.5m), medium (1.5–6m) and large ({\textgreater}6m) scale. Combining features with lower correlation coefficient and better classification performance would improve classification accuracy. The feature depicting homogeneity or heterogeneity of points would be calculated at a small scale, and the features to smooth points at a medium scale and the features of height different at large scale. As to the neighborhood definition, cuboid and cylinder were recommended. This study can guide the selection of optimal geometric features with adaptive neighborhood scale for urban land cover classification.},

	abstract = {Estimates of the magnitude and distribution of aboveground carbon in Earth's forests remain uncertain, yet knowledge of forest carbon content at a global scale is critical for forest management in support of climate mitigation. In light of this knowledge gap, several upcoming spaceborne missions aim to map forest aboveground biomass, and many new biomass products are expected from these datasets. As these new missions host different technologies, each with relative strengths and weaknesses for biomass retrieval, as well as different spatial resolutions, consistently comparing or combining biomass estimates from these new datasets will be challenging. This paper presents a demonstration of an inter-comparison of biomass estimates from simulations of three {NASA} missions ({GEDI}, {ICESat}-2 and {NISAR}) over Sonoma county in California, {USA}. We use a high resolution, locally calibrated airborne lidar map as our reference dataset, and emphasize the importance of considering uncertainties in both reference maps and spaceborne estimates when conducting biomass product validation. {GEDI} and {ICESat}-2 were simulated from airborne lidar point clouds, while {UAVSAR}'s L-band backscatter was used as a proxy for {NISAR}. To estimate biomass for the lidar missions we used {GEDI}'s footprint-level biomass algorithms, and also adapted these for application to {ICESat}-2. For {UAVSAR}, we developed a locally trained biomass model, calibrated against the {ALS} reference map. Each mission simulation was evaluated in comparison to the local reference map at its native product resolution (25 m, 100 m transect, and 1 ha) yielding {RMSEs} of 57\%, 75\%, and 89\% for {GEDI}, {NISAR}, and {ICESat}-2 respectively. {RMSE} values increased for {GEDI}'s power beam during simulated daytime conditions (64\%), coverage beam during nighttime conditions (72\%), and coverage beam daytime conditions (87\%). We also test the application of {GEDI}'s biomass modeling framework for estimation of biomass from {ICESat}-2, and find that {ICESat}-2 yields reasonable biomass estimates, particularly in relatively short, open canopies. Results suggest that while all three missions will produce datasets useful for biomass mapping, tall, dense canopies such as those found in Sonoma County present the greatest challenges for all three missions, while steep slopes also prove challenging for single-date {SAR}-based biomass retrievals. Our methods provide guidance for the inter-comparison and validation of spaceborne biomass estimates through the use of airborne lidar reference maps, and could be repeated with on-orbit estimates in any area with high quality field plot and {ALS} data. These methods allow for regional interpretations and filtering of multi-mission biomass estimates toward improved wall-to-wall biomass maps through data fusion.},

	abstract = {The full realization of the potential of remote sensing as a source of environmental information requires an ability to generalize in space and time. Here, the ability to generalize in space was investigated through an analysis of the transferability of predictive relations for the estimation of tropical forest biomass from Landsat {TM} data between sites in Brazil, Malaysia and Thailand. The data sets for each test site were acquired and processed in a similar fashion to facilitate the analyses. Three types of predictive relation, based on vegetation indices, multiple regression and feedforward neural networks, were developed for biomass estimation at each site. For each site, the strongest relationships between the biomass predicted and that measured from field survey was obtained with a neural network developed specifically for the site (r{\textgreater}0.71, significant at the 99\% level of confidence). However, with each type of approach problems in transferring a relation to another site were observed. In particular, it was apparent that the accuracy of prediction, as indicated by the correlation coefficient between predicted and measured biomass, declined when a relation was transferred to a site other than that upon which it was developed. Part of this problem lies with the observed variation in the relative contribution of the different spectral wavebands to predictive relations for biomass estimation between sites. It was, for example, apparent that the spectral composition of the vegetation indices most strongly related to biomass differed greatly between the sites. Consequently, the relationship between predicted and measured biomass derived from vegetation indices differed markedly in both strength and direction between sites. Although the incorporation of test site location information into an analysis resulted in an increase in the strength of the relationship between predicted and actual biomass, considerable further research is required on the problems associated with transferring predictive relations.},

This study aims to evaluate the potential of S-2 {MSI} sensor for estimation of canopy chlorophyll content, leaf area index ({LAI}) and leaf chlorophyll concentration ({LCC}) using data from multiple field campaigns. Included in the assessed field campaigns are results from {SEN}3Exp in Barrax, Spain composed of 35 elementary sampling units ({ESUs}) of {LCC} and {LAI} which have been assessed for correlation with simulated {MSI} data using a {CASI} airborne imaging spectrometer. Analysis also presents results from {SicilyS}2EVAL, a campaign consisting of 25 {ESUs} in Sicily, Italy supported by a simultaneous Specim Aisa-Eagle data acquisition. In addition, these results were compared to outputs from the {PROSAIL} model for similar values of biophysical variables in the {ESUs}. The paper in turn assessed the scope of S-2 for retrieval of biophysical variables using these combined datasets through investigating the performance of the relevant Vegetation Indices ({VIs}) as well as presenting the novel Inverted Red-Edge Chlorophyll Index ({IRECI}) and Sentinel-2 Red-Edge Position (S2REP). Results indicated significant relationships between both canopy chlorophyll content and {LAI} for simulated {MSI} data using {IRECI} or the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index ({NDVI}) while S2REP and the {MERIS} Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index ({MTCI}) were found to have the strongest correlation for retrieval of {LCC}.},

Among all available remote sensing data and methods, Synthetic Aperture Radar ({SAR}) data in combination with decision tree based machine learning algorithms has produced favourable results in estimating higher biomass values. Suitability of this method for dense tropical forests has not been properly checked with an adequate number of studies. In this study, aboveground biomass was estimated for two major tree species, Shorea robusta, and Tectona grandis, of Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary, a tropical forest situated in northern India. Aboveground biomass was estimated by combining C-band {SAR} data from Sentinel-1A satellite, texture images generated from Sentinel-1A data, vegetation indices produced using Sentinel-2A data and ground inventory plots. Decision tree-based machine learning algorithms were used in place of parametric regression models for establishing a relationship between fields measured values and remotely sensed parameters. Using random forest model with a combination of vegetation indices with {SAR} backscatter as predictor variables shows the best result for S. robusta forest, with a coefficient of determination value of 0.71 and an {RMSE} value of 105.027 t/ha. In T. grandis forest best result can be found in the same combination but for stochastic gradient boosted model with a coefficient of determination value of 0.6 and an {RMSE} value of 79.45 t/ha. This study shows that Sentinel series satellite data has exceptional capabilities in estimating dense forest {AGB} and machine learning algorithms can be very helpful to do so.},

A dramatic decrease in and almost complete disappearance of chlorophyll (Chl) gave an opportunity for the investigation of relations between the reflectance changes and the pigment concentrations. The signature analysis of reflectance spectra indicated that in the green to yellow leaves of both species the maximal standard deviation of reflectance coincided with the red absorption maximum of Chla. However, within the leaves with high Chl, minimal sensitivity to pigment variations was observed at 675 nm. The maximal standard deviations were found near 550 to 560 and 700 to 710 nm. The revealed spectral features can serve as sensitive indicators of early stages of leaf senescence. The several functions of reflectance were found to be directly proportional to Chl (a square of correlation coefficient of more than 0.97); that allows an assessment of the pigment concentration ranging from 0.5 to 27.5 nmol/cm2 with an estimation error of less than 1.5 nmol/cm2. This makes its possible to precisely determine Chla with a background of variable and high pigment concentration.},

	abstract = {Leaf chlorophyll content provides valuable information about physiological status of plants. Reflectance measurement makes it possible to quickly and non-destructively assess, in situ, the chlorophyll content in leaves. Our objective was to investigate the spectral behavior of the relationship between reflectance and chlorophyll content and to develop a technique for non-destructive chlorophyll estimation in leaves with a wide range of pigment content and composition using reflectance in a few broad spectral bands. Spectral reflectance of maple, chestnut, wild vine and beech leaves in a wide range of pigment content and composition was investigated. It was shown that reciprocal reflectance (R{\textless})−1 in the spectral range λ from 520 to 550 nm and 695 to 705 nm related closely to the total chlorophyll content in leaves of all species. Subtraction of near infra-red reciprocal reflectance, ({RNIR})−1, from (R{\textless})−1 made index [(R{\textless})−1-({RNIR})−1] linearly proportional to the total chlorophyll content in spectral ranges λ from 525 to 555 nm and from 695 to 725 nm with coefficient of determination r2 ≫ 0.94. To adjust for differences in leaf structure, the product of the latter index and {NIR} reflectance [(Rλ)−1-({RNIR})−1]*({RNIR}) was used; this further increased the accuracy of the chlorophyll estimation in the range λ from 520 to 585 nm and from 695 to 740 nm. Two independent data sets were used to validate the developed algorithms. The root mean square error of the chlorophyll prediction did not exceed 50 μmol/m2 in leaves with total chlorophyll ranged from 1 to 830 μmol/m2.},

Remote sensing is an efficient tool for collecting spatially explicit information on forest attributes. With the launch of the Sentinel-2 mission, new opportunities have arisen for mapping tree species owing to its spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution. The short revisit cycle (five days) is crucial in vegetation mapping because of the reflectance changes caused by phenological phases. In our study, we evaluated the utility of the Sentinel-2 time series for mapping tree species in the complex, mixed forests of the Polish Carpathian Mountains. We mapped the following nine tree species: common beech, silver birch, common hornbeam, silver fir, sycamore maple, European larch, grey alder, Scots pine, and Norway spruce. We used the Sentinel-2 time series from 2018, with 18 images included in the study. Different combinations of Sentinel-2 imagery were selected based on mean decrease accuracy ({MDA}) and mean decrease Gini ({MDG}) measures, in addition to temporal phonological pattern analysis. Tree species discrimination was performed using the Random Forest classification algorithm. Our results showed that the use of the Sentinel-2 time series instead of single date imagery significantly improved forest tree species mapping, by approximately 5\&ndash;10\% of overall accuracy. In particular, combining images from spring and autumn resulted in better species discrimination.},

In high-dimensional regression or classification frameworks, variable selection is a difficult task, that becomes even more challenging in the presence of highly correlated predictors. Firstly we provide a theoretical study of the permutation importance measure for an additive regression model. This allows us to describe how the correlation between predictors impacts the permutation importance. Our results motivate the use of the recursive feature elimination ({RFE}) algorithm for variable selection in this context. This algorithm recursively eliminates the variables using permutation importance measure as a ranking criterion. Next various simulation experiments illustrate the efficiency of the {RFE} algorithm for selecting a small number of variables together with a good prediction error. Finally, this selection algorithm is tested on the Landsat Satellite data from the {UCI} Machine Learning Repository.},

This study examines the potential for use of suites of vegetation indices ({VIs}) from the proposed Sentinel 2 sensor to describe vegetation states in grasslands and savannas for a North American transect. Hyperion hyperspectral data from the {EO}-1 satellite were used to simulate Sentinel 2, {MODIS} (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and {VIIRS} (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) images for field sites in Alberta, North Dakota and Texas that represent the continuum from short grass prairie to oak savanna and are intermingled with agriculture. Indices representing photosynthetic pigments (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Carotenoid Reflectance Index, Anthocyanin Reflectance Index and Red-Green Ratio), vegetation and landscape water content (Normalized Difference Infrared Index), senescent vegetation and soil (Short Wave Infrared Ratio and Plant Senescence Reflectance Index) and herbaceous biomass (Soil Adjusted Total Vegetation Index) were used. There were distinct differences among sites in the relative sensitivity of different {VIs} depending upon moisture status, tree cover and type of grassland. Simple multi-variate models based on mean values of {VIs} showed limited ability to predict land cover classes and nominal vegetation states. However, analysis of sample areas using pixels as individual observations within a statistical distribution indicated that subtle variation and gradients within management or land units could be used to characterize fine differences in selected nominal states at each site. Despite some differences in band locations, all {VIs} except the anthocyanin reflectance index were scalable between Sentinel 2 and {MODIS} and {VIIRS} data. A framework for using suites of {VIs} as indicators of vegetation states that could be applied to the state and transition model approach applied by the {US} Natural Resource Conservation Service is described. Land types can be effectively characterized by pixel value distribution histograms, and statistical metrics may be used as indicators of status and change. However, time series are needed to fully capture states and state changes, since grasslands and savannas have such high levels of spectral and phenological variation.},

The allometric models were applied to Geoscience Laser Altimeter System ({GLAS}) data to calculate {AGB} at the footprint level. We then mapped a 30 m resolution national forest {AGB} by relating the {GLAS} footprint {AGB} to various variables derived from Landsat images and Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar ({PALSAR}) data. We estimated the average forest {AGB} to be 69.88 Mg/ha with a standard deviation of 35.38 Mg/ha and the total {AGB} carbon stock to be 5.44 {PgC} in China. Our {AGB} estimates corresponded reasonably well with {AGB} inventories from the top ten provinces in the forested area, and the coefficient of determination and root mean square error were 0.73 and 20.65 Mg/ha, respectively. We found that the main uncertainties for {AGB} estimation could be attributed to errors in allometric models and in height measurements by the {GLAS}. We also found that Landsat-derived variables outperform {PALSAR}-derived variables and that the textural features of {PALSAR} better support forest {AGB} estimates than backscattered intensity.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a prototype Carbon Monitoring System ({CMS}) developed to produce regionally unbiased annual estimates of aboveground biomass ({AGB}). Our {CMS} employed a bottom-up, two-step modeling strategy beginning with a spatially and temporally biased sample: project datasets collected and contributed by {US} Forest Service ({USFS}) and other forestry stakeholders in 29 different project areas in the northwestern {USA}. Plot-level {AGB} estimates collected in the project areas served as the response variable for predicting {AGB} primarily from lidar metrics of canopy height and density (R2 = 0.8, {RMSE} = 115 Mg ha−1, Bias = 2 Mg ha−1). This landscape model was used to map {AGB} estimates at 30 m resolution where lidar data were available. A stratified random sample of {AGB} pixels from these landscape-level {AGB} maps then served as training data for predicting {AGB} regionally from Landsat image time series variables processed through {LandTrendr}. In addition, climate metrics calculated from downscaled 30 year climate normals were considered as predictors in both models, as were topographic metrics calculated from elevation data; these environmental predictors allowed {AGB} estimation over the full range of observations with the regional model (R2 = 0.8, {RMSE} = 152 Mg ha−1, Bias = 9 Mg ha−1), including higher {AGB} values ({\textgreater}400 Mg ha−1) where spectral predictors alone saturate. For both the landscape and regional models, the machine-learning algorithm Random Forests ({RF}) was consistently applied to select predictor variables and estimate {AGB}. We then calibrated the regional {AGB} maps using field plot data systematically collected without bias by the national Forest Inventory and Analysis ({FIA}) Program. We found both our project landscape and regional, annual {AGB} estimates to be unbiased with respect to {FIA} estimates (Biases of 1\% and 0.7\%, respectively) and conclude that they are well suited to inform forest management and planning decisions by our contributing stakeholders.

This paper presents an initial analysis of the {MODIS} {NDVI} and {EVI} performance from both radiometric and biophysical perspectives. We utilize a combination of site-intensive and regionally extensive approaches to demonstrate the performance and validity of the two indices. Our results showed a good correspondence between airborne-measured, top-of-canopy reflectances and {VI} values with those from the {MODIS} sensor at four intensively measured test sites representing semi-arid grass/shrub, savanna, and tropical forest biomes. Simultaneously derived field biophysical measures also demonstrated the scientific utility of the {MODIS} {VI}. Multitemporal profiles of the {MODIS} {VIs} over numerous biome types in North and South America well represented their seasonal phenologies. Comparisons of the {MODIS}-{NDVI} with the {NOAA}-14, 1-km {AVHRR}-{NDVI} temporal profiles showed that the {MODIS}-based index performed with higher fidelity. The dynamic range of the {MODIS} {VIs} are presented and their sensitivities in discriminating vegetation differences are evaluated in sparse and dense vegetation areas.

	abstract = {Forests are important ecosystems that are under increasing pressure from human use and environmental change, and have a significant ability to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and are therefore the focus of policy efforts aimed at reducing deforestation and degradation as well as increasing afforestation and reforestation for climate mitigation. Critical to these efforts is the accurate monitoring, reporting and verification of current forest cover and carbon stocks. For planning, the additional step of modeling is required to quantitatively estimate forest carbon sequestration potential in response to alternative land-use and management decisions. To be most useful and of decision-relevant quality, these model estimates must be at very high spatial resolution and with very high accuracy to capture important heterogeneity on the land surface and connect to monitoring efforts. Here, we present results from a new forest carbon monitoring and modeling system that combines high-resolution remote sensing, field data, and ecological modeling to estimate contemporary above-ground forest carbon stocks, and project future forest carbon sequestration potential for the state of Maryland at 90 m resolution. Statewide, the contemporary above-ground carbon stock was estimated to be 110.8 Tg C (100.3–125.8 Tg C), with a corresponding mean above-ground biomass density of 103.7 Mg ha−1 which was within 2\% of independent empirically-based estimates. The forest above-ground carbon sequestration potential for the state was estimated to be much larger at 314.8 Tg C, and the forest above-ground carbon sequestration potential gap (i.e. potential-current) was estimated to be 204.1 Tg C, nearly double the current stock. These results imply a large statewide potential for future carbon sequestration from afforestation and reforestation activities. The high spatial resolution of the model estimates underpinning these totals demonstrate important heterogeneity across the state and can inform prioritization of actual afforestation/reforestation opportunities. With this approach, it is now possible to quantify both the forest carbon stock and future carbon sequestration potential over large policy relevant areas with sufficient accuracy and spatial resolution to significantly advance planning.},

	abstract = {Measurements of forest structure are important for wildlife habitat management. An optimal strategy for mapping forest structure would include detailed measurements of the vertical dimension, which are traditionally provided by field sampling, together with the broad spatial coverage afforded by remote sensing. While no single sensor is capable of delivering this at the present time, it should be possible to combine information from multiple sensors to achieve a reasonable approximation. In this study, we compare estimates of forest structural metrics derived from remote sensing to measurements obtained in the field (large tree maximum canopy height, mean canopy height, standard deviation canopy height, and biomass). We then statistically combine structural information from {LiDAR}, {RaDAR}, and passive optical sensors in an attempt to improve accuracy of our estimates. The results of this study indicate that {LiDAR} is the best single sensor for estimating canopy height and biomass. The addition of {ETM}+ metrics significantly improved {LiDAR} estimates of large tree structure, while Quickbird and {InSAR}/{SAR} improved estimates either marginally or not at all. The combination of all sensors was more accurate than {LiDAR} alone, but only marginally better than the combination of {LiDAR} and {ETM}+. Structure metrics from {LiDAR} and {RaDAR} are essentially redundant, as are {ETM}+ and Quickbird.},

	abstract = {The study presents the preliminary results of two classification exercises assessing the capabilities of pre-operational (August 2015) Sentinel-2 (S2) data for mapping crop types and tree species. In the first case study, an S2 image was used to map six summer crop species in Lower Austria as well as winter crops/bare soil. Crop type maps are needed to account for crop-specific water use and for agricultural statistics. Crop type information is also useful to parametrize crop growth models for yield estimation, as well as for the retrieval of vegetation biophysical variables using radiative transfer models. The second case study aimed to map seven different deciduous and coniferous tree species in Germany. Detailed information about tree species distribution is important for forest management and to assess potential impacts of climate change. In our S2 data assessment, crop and tree species maps were produced at 10 m spatial resolution by combining the ten S2 spectral channels with 10 and 20 m pixel size. A supervised Random Forest classifier ({RF}) was deployed and trained with appropriate ground truth. In both case studies, S2 data confirmed its expected capabilities to produce reliable land cover maps. Cross-validated overall accuracies ranged between 65\% (tree species) and 76\% (crop types). The study confirmed the high value of the red-edge and shortwave infrared ({SWIR}) bands for vegetation mapping. Also, the blue band was important in both study sites. The S2-bands in the near infrared were amongst the least important channels. The object based image analysis ({OBIA}) and the classical pixel-based classification achieved comparable results, mainly for the cropland. As only single date acquisitions were available for this study, the full potential of S2 data could not be assessed. In the future, the two twin S2 satellites will offer global coverage every five days and therefore permit to concurrently exploit unprecedented spectral and temporal information with high spatial resolution.},

different results, and (b) {NDWI} thresholds vary depending on the proportions of subpixel water/non-water components. We need to evaluate all the {NDWIs} for determining the best performing index and to establish appropriate thresholds for clearly identifying water features. We used the spectral
data obtained from a spectral library to simulate the satellite sensors Landsat {ETM}+, {SPOT}-5, {ASTER}, and {MODIS}, and calculated the simulated {NDWI} in different forms. We found that the {NDWI} calculated from (green – {SWIR})/(green + {SWIR}), where {SWIR} is the shorter wavelength region (1.2

In this review, we summarize the studies combining lidar and radar in estimating forest {AGB}. We discuss the complementary use of lidar and radar according to the relevance of the added value. The most promising prospects for combining lidar and radar data are in the use of lidar-derived ground elevations for improving large-area biomass estimates from radar,  and in upscaling of lidar-based {AGB} data across large areas covered by spaceborne  radar missions.},

	abstract = {Providing accurate maps of mangroves, where the spatial scales of the mapped features correspond to the ecological structures and processes, as opposed to pixel sizes and mapping approaches, is a major challenge for remote sensing. This study developed and evaluated an object-based approach to understand what types of mangrove information can be mapped using different image datasets (Landsat {TM}, {ALOS} {AVNIR}-2, {WorldView}-2, and {LiDAR}). We compared and contrasted the ability of these images to map five levels of mangrove features, including vegetation boundary, mangrove stands, mangrove zonations, individual tree crowns, and species communities. We used the Moreton Bay site in Australia as the primary site to develop the classification rule sets and Karimunjawa Island in Indonesia to test the applicability of the rule sets. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of a conceptual hierarchical model for mapping specific mangrove features at discrete spatial scales. However, the rule sets developed in this study require modification to map similar mangrove features at different locations or when using image data acquired by different sensors. Across the hierarchical levels, smaller object sizes (i.e., tree crowns) required more complex classification rule sets. Incorporation of contextual information (e.g., distance and elevation) increased the overall mapping accuracy at the mangrove stand level (from 85\% to 94\%) and mangrove zonation level (from 53\% to 59\%). We found that higher image spatial resolution, larger object size, and fewer land-cover classes result in higher mapping accuracies. This study highlights the potential of selected images and mapping techniques to map mangrove features, and provides guidance for how to do this effectively through  multi-scale mangrove composition mapping.},

	abstract = {Forest processes that play an essential role in carbon sequestration, such as light use efficiency, photosynthetic capacity, and trace gas exchange, are closely tied to the three-dimensional structure of forest canopies. However, the vertical distribution of leaf traits is not uniform; leaves at varying vertical positions within the canopy are physiologically unique due to differing light and environmental conditions, which leads to higher carbon storage than if light conditions were constant throughout the canopy. Due to this within-canopy variation, three-dimensional structural traits are critical to improving our estimates of global carbon cycling and storage by Earth system models and to better understanding the effects of disturbances on carbon sequestration in forested ecosystems. In this study, we describe a reproducible and open-source methodology using the R programming language for estimating leaf area density ({LAD}; the total leaf area per unit of volume) from airborne {LiDAR}. Using this approach, we compare {LAD} estimates at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in Maryland, {USA}, from two airborne {LiDAR} systems, {NEON} {AOP} and {NASA} G-{LiHT}, which differ in survey and instrument specifications, collections goals, and laser pulse densities. Furthermore, we address the impacts of the spatial scale of analysis as well as differences in canopy penetration and pulse density on {LAD} and leaf area index ({LAI}) estimates, while offering potential solutions to enhance the accuracy of these estimates. {LAD} estimates from airborne {LiDAR} can be used to describe the three-dimensional structure of forests across entire landscapes. This information can help inform forest management and conservation decisions related to the estimation of aboveground biomass and productivity, the response of forests to large-scale disturbances, the impacts of drought on forest health, the conservation of bird habitat, as well as a host of other important forest processes and responses.},

	abstract = {For decades, wildfire studies have utilized fire occurrence as the primary data source for investigating the causes and effects of wildfire on the landscape. Fire occurrence data fall primarily into two categories: ignition points and perimeter polygons which are used to calculate a ‘burned area’ for a fire. However, understanding the relationships between climate and fire or between fire and its ecological effects requires an understanding of the burn heterogeneity across the landscape and the area within fire perimeters that remains unburned. This research characterizes unburned areas within fire perimeters, which provide ecological refugia and seed source for post-fire regeneration. We utilized differenced Normalized Burn Ratio ({dNBR}) data to examine the frequency, extent, and spatial patterns of unburned area in three national parks across the western {US} (Glacier, Yosemite, and Yukon-Charley Rivers). We characterized unburned area within fire perimeters by fire size and severity, characterized distance to an unburned area across the burned portion of the fire, and investigated patch dynamics of unburned patches within the fire perimeter. From 1984 through 2009, the total area within the fire perimeters that was classified as unburned from {dNBR} was 37\% for Yosemite, 17\% for Glacier, and 14\% for Yukon-Charley. Variation in unburned area between fires was highest in Yosemite and lowest in Yukon-Charley. The unburned proportion significantly decreased with increasing fire size and severity across all three parks. Unburned patch size increased with size of fire perimeter, but patches decreased in density. There were no temporal trends in unburned area found. These results raise questions about the validity of relationships found between external forcing agents, such as climate, and ‘burned area’ values derived solely from polygon fire perimeters.},

This study demonstrates the applicability of {RapidEye} multi-spectral data for estimation of {LAI} and biomass of two crop types (corn and soybean) with different canopy structure, leaf structure and photosynthetic pathways. The advantages of Rapid Eye in terms of increased temporal resolution (∼daily), high spatial resolution (∼5m) and enhanced spectral information (includes red-edge band) are explored as an individual sensor and as part of a multi-sensor constellation. Seven vegetation indices based on combinations of reflectance in green, red, red-edge and near infrared bands were derived from {RapidEye} imagery between 2011 and 2013. {LAI} and biomass data were collected during the same period for calibration and validation of the relationships between vegetation indices and {LAI} and dry above-ground biomass. Most indices showed sensitivity to {LAI} from emergence to 8m2/m2. The normalized difference vegetation index ({NDVI}), the red-edge {NDVI} and the green {NDVI} were insensitive to crop type and had coefficients of variations ({CV}) ranging between 19 and 27\%; and coefficients of determination ranging between 86 and 88\%. The {NDVI} performed best for the estimation of dry leaf biomass ({CV}=27\% and r2=090) and was also insensitive to crop type. The red-edge indices did not show any significant improvement in {LAI} and biomass estimation over traditional multispectral indices. Cumulative vegetation indices showed strong performance for estimation of total dry above-ground biomass, especially for corn ({CV}≤20\%). This study demonstrated that continuous crop {LAI} monitoring over time and space at the field level can be achieved using a combination of {RapidEye}, Landsat and {SPOT} data and sensor-dependant best-fit functions. This approach eliminates/reduces the need for reflectance resampling, {VIs} inter-calibration and spatial resampling.},

It has been suggested that estimates can be improved by building species- or strata-specific biomass models. However, few studies have attempted a systematic analysis of the benefits of such stratification, especially in combination with other factors such as sensor type, statistical prediction method and sampling design of the reference inventory data. We addressed this topic by analyzing the impact of stratifying forest data into three classes (broadleaved, coniferous and mixed forest). We compare predictive accuracy (a) between the strata (b) to a case without stratification for a set of pre-selected predictors from airborne {LiDAR} and hyperspectral data obtained in a managed mixed forest site in southwestern Germany. We used 5 commonly applied algorithms for biomass predictions on bootstrapped subsamples of the data to obtain cross validated {RMSE} and r2 diagnostics. Those values were analyzed in a factorial design by an analysis of variance ({ANOVA}) to rank the relative importance of each factor. Selected models were used for wall-to-wall mapping of biomass estimates and their associated uncertainty. The results revealed marginal advantages for the strata-specific prediction models over the unstratified ones, which were more obvious on the wall-to-wall mapped area-based predictions. Yet further tests are necessary to establish the generality of these results. Input data type and statistical prediction method are concluded to remain the two most crucial factors for the quality of remote sensing-assisted biomass models.},

National statistics on forest resources provide estimates of forest area, timber volume, and growth of timber by age classes with known precision.

The objective of this study was to improve the accuracy and reliability of the biomass expansion factors ({BEFs}) and to develop expansion factors that are dependent on stand age and dominant tree species. For development of {BEFs}, we applied volume and biomass equations to describe the allometry of single trees and a systematic network of forest inventory data to determine variation in stand structure. The results of this study indicate that the proportions of most biomass components vary considerably during the rotation. We conclude that the reliability of the national carbon stock inventory could be improved by applying these age-dependent {BEFs}, which are formulated on the basis of representative data and which include an estimate of uncertainty.},

Differences in root-mean-square error ({RMSE}) between models for above ground total, stem wood, stem bark, live branch and foliage biomass were 8.1, 5.1, 2.9, 2.1 and 1.1 Mg ha−1, respectively.},

	abstract = {Estimating forest structural attributes in planted forests is crucial for sustainably management of forests and helps to understand the contributions of forests to global carbon storage. The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-Light Detecting and Ranging ({UAV}-{LiDAR}) has become a promising technology and attempts to be used for forest management, due to its capacity to provide highly accurate estimations of three-dimensional (3D) forest structural information with a lower cost, higher flexibility and finer resolution than airborne {LiDAR}. In this study, the effectiveness of plot-level metrics (i.e., distributional, canopy volume and Weibull-fitted metrics) and individual-tree-summarized metrics (i.e., maximum, minimum and mean height of trees and the number of trees from the individual tree detection ({ITD}) results) derived from {UAV}-{LiDAR} point clouds were assessed, then these metrics were used to fit estimation models of six forest structural attributes by parametric (i.e., partial least squares ({PLS})) and non-parametric (i.e., k-Nearest Neighbors (k-{NN}) and Random Forest ({RF})) approaches, within a Ginkgo plantation in east China. In addition, we assessed the effects of {UAV}-{LiDAR} point cloud density on the derived metrics and individual tree segmentation results, and evaluated the correlations of these metrics with aboveground biomass ({AGB}) by a sensitivity analysis. The results showed that, in general, models based on both plot-level and individual-tree-summarized metrics ({CV}-R2 = 0.66–0.97, {rRMSE} = 2.83–23.35\%) performed better than models based on the plot-level metrics only ({CV}-R2 = 0.62–0.97, {rRMSE} = 3.81–27.64\%). {PLS} had a relatively high prediction accuracy for Lorey’s mean height ({CV}-R2 = 0.97, {rRMSE} = 2.83\%), whereas k-{NN} performed well for predicting volume ({CV}-R2 = 0.94, {rRMSE} = 8.95\%) and {AGB} ({CV}-R2 = 0.95, {rRMSE} = 8.81\%). For the point cloud density sensitivity analysis, the canopy volume metrics showed a higher dependence on point cloud density than other metrics. {ITD} results showed a relatively high accuracy (F1-score {\textgreater} 74.93\%) when the point cloud density was higher than 10\% (16 pts·m−2). The correlations between {AGB} and the metrics of height percentiles, lower height level of canopy return densities and canopy cover appeared stable across different point cloud densities when the point cloud density was reduced from 50\% (80 pts·m−2) to 5\% (8 pts·m−2).},

This paper explores {AGB} estimation using Landsat Thematic Mapper ({TM}) data in the eastern and western Brazilian Amazon, and discusses the impacts of forest stand structure on {AGB} estimation. Estimating {AGB} is still a challenging task, especially for the sites with complicated biophysical environments. The {TM} spectral responses are more suitable for {AGB} estimation in the sites with relatively simple forest stand structure than for the sites with complicated forest stand structure. Conversely, textures appear more important than spectral responses in {AGB} estimation in the sites with complicated forest stand structure. A combination of spectral responses and textures improves {AGB} estimation performance. Different study areas having various biophysical conditions affect {AGB} estimation performance.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing-based methods of aboveground biomass ({AGB}) estimation in forest ecosystems have gained increased attention, and substantial research has been conducted in the past three decades. This paper provides a survey of current biomass estimation methods using remote sensing data and discusses four critical issues – collection of field-based biomass reference data, extraction and selection of suitable variables from remote sensing data, identification of proper algorithms to develop biomass estimation models, and uncertainty analysis to refine the estimation procedure. Additionally, we discuss the impacts of scales on biomass estimation performance and describe a general biomass estimation procedure. Although optical sensor and radar data have been primary sources for {AGB} estimation, data saturation is an important factor resulting in estimation uncertainty. {LIght} Detection and Ranging (lidar) can remove data saturation, but limited availability of lidar data prevents its extensive application. This literature survey has indicated the limitations of using single-sensor data for biomass estimation and the importance of integrating multi-sensor/scale remote sensing data to produce accurate estimates over large areas. More research is needed to extract a vertical vegetation structure (e.g. canopy height) from interferometry synthetic aperture radar ({InSAR}) or optical stereo images to incorporate it into horizontal structures (e.g. canopy cover) in biomass estimation modeling.},

On the other hand, forest biomass uncertainty analysis research has only recently obtained sufficient attention due to the difficulty in collecting reference data. This paper provides a brief overview of current forest biomass estimation methods using both {TM} and {LiDAR} data. A case study is then presented that demonstrates the forest biomass estimation methods and uncertainty analysis. Results indicate that Landsat {TM} data can provide adequate biomass estimates for secondary succession but are not suitable for mature forest biomass estimates due to data saturation problems. {LiDAR} can overcome {TM}’s shortcoming providing better biomass estimation performance but has not been extensively applied in practice due to data availability constraints. The uncertainty analysis indicates that various sources affect the performance of forest biomass/carbon estimation. With that said, the clear dominate sources of uncertainty are the variation of input sample plot data and data saturation problem related to optical sensors. A possible solution to increasing the confidence in forest biomass estimates is to integrate the strengths of multisensor data.},

An increase of reflectance between 550 and 740 nm accompanied senescence-induced degradation of chlorophyll (Chl), whereas in the range 400–500 nm it remained low, due to retention of carotenoids (Car).

The plant senescing reflectance index in the form (R678−R500)/R750 was found to be sensitive to the Car/Chl ratio, and was used as a quantitative measure of leaf senescence and fruit ripening.

Along with the use of the {NCEP} Eta model and its Data Assimilation System (at 32-km–45-layer resolution with 3-hourly output), the hallmarks of the {NARR} are the incorporation of hourly assimilation of precipitation, which leverages a comprehensive precipitation analysis effort, the use of a recent version of the Noah land surface model, and the use of numerous other datasets that are additional or improved compared to the {GR}. Following the practice applied to {NCEP}'s {GR}, the 25-yr {NARR} retrospective production period (1979–2003) is augmented by the construction and daily execution of a system for near-real-time continuation of the {NARR}, known as the Regional Climate Data Assimilation System (R-{CDAS}). Highlights of the {NARR} results are presented: precipitation over the continental United States ({CONUS}), which is seen to be very near the ingested analyzed precipitation; fits of tropospheric temperatures and winds to rawinsonde observations; and fits of 2-m temperatures and 10-m winds to surface station observations. The aforementioned fits are compared to those of the {NCEP}–Department of Energy ({DOE}) Global Reanalysis ({GR}2). Not only have the expectations cited above been fully met, but very substantial improvements in the accuracy of temperatures and winds compared to that of {GR}2 are achieved throughout the troposphere. Finally, the numerous datasets produced are outlined and information is provided on the data archiving and present data availability.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

The launch of the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 ({ICESat}-2) on September 15th, 2018 offers an unparalleled opportunity to assess {AGB} at large scales using along-track samples that will be provided during its three-year mission. The main goal of this study was to investigate deep learning ({DL}) neural networks for mapping {AGB} with {ICESat}-2, using simulated photon-counting lidar ({PCL})-estimated {AGB} for daytime, nighttime, and no noise scenarios, Landsat imagery, canopy cover, and land cover maps. The study was carried out in Sam Houston National Forest located in south-east Texas, using a simulated {PCL}-estimated {AGB} along two years of planned {ICESat}-2 profiles. The primary tasks were to investigate and determine neural network architecture, examine the hyper-parameter settings, and subsequently generate wall-to-wall {AGB} maps. A first set of models were developed using vegetation indices calculated from single-date Landsat imagery, canopy cover, and land cover, and a second set of models were generated using metrics from one year of Landsat imagery with canopy cover and land cover maps. To compare the effectiveness of final models, comparisons with Random Forests ({RF}) models were made. The deep neural network ({DNN}) models achieved R2 values of 0.42, 0.49, and 0.50 for the daytime, nighttime, and no noise scenarios respectively. With the extended dataset containing metrics calculated from Landsat images acquired on different dates, substantial improvements in model performance for all data scenarios were noted. The R2 values increased to 0.64, 0.66, and 0.67 for the daytime, nighttime, and no noise scenarios. Comparisons with Random forest ({RF}) prediction models highlighted similar results, with the same R2 and root mean square error ({RMSE}) range (15\&ndash;16 Mg/ha) for daytime and nighttime scenarios. Findings suggest that there is potential for mapping {AGB} using a combinatory approach with {ICESat}-2 and Landsat-derived products with {DL}.},

While this mission is primarily aimed at capturing ice measurements, {ICESat}-2 also provides data over vegetated areas, offering the capability to gain insights into ecosystem structure and the potential to contribute to the sustainable management of forests. This study involved an examination of the utility of {ICESat}-2 for estimating forest aboveground biomass ({AGB}). The objectives of this study were to: (1) investigate the use of canopy metrics for estimating {AGB}, using data extracted from an {ICESat}-2 transect over forests in south-east Texas; (2) compare the accuracy for estimating {AGB} using data from the strong beam and weak beam; and (3) upscale predicted {AGB} estimates using variables from Landsat multispectral imagery and land cover and canopy cover maps, to generate a 30 m spatial resolution {AGB} map. Methods previously developed with simulated {ICESat}-2 data over Sam Houston National Forest ({SHNF}) in southeast Texas were adapted using actual data from an adjacent {ICESat}-2 transect over similar vegetation conditions. Custom noise filtering and photon classification algorithms were applied to {ICESat}-2\&rsquo;s geolocated photon data ({ATL}03) for one beam pair, consisting of a strong and weak beam, and canopy height estimates were retrieved. Canopy height parameters were extracted from 100 m segments in the along-track direction for estimating {AGB}, using regression analysis. {ICESat}-2-derived {AGB} estimates were then extrapolated to develop a 30 m {AGB} map for the study area, using vegetation indices from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager ({OLI}), National Land Cover Database ({NLCD}) landcover and canopy cover, with random forests ({RF}). The {AGB} estimation models used few canopy parameters and suggest the possibility for applying well-developed methods for modeling {AGB} with airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) data, using processed {ICESat}-2 data. The final regression model achieved a R2 and root mean square error ({RMSE}) value of 0.62 and 24.63 Mg/ha for estimating {AGB} and {RF} model evaluation with a separate test set yielded a R2 of 0.58 and {RMSE} of 23.89 Mg/ha. Findings provide an initial look at the ability of {ICESat}-2 to estimate {AGB} and serve as a basis for further upscaling efforts.},

As of August 10th the local media had reported the death of three people, over 200 people injured, over 950 habitants evacuated, and 50 houses damaged. This study presents the preliminary results of the assessment of several spectral indices to evaluate the burn severity of Madeira fires during August 2016. These spectral indices were calculated using the new European satellite Sentinel-2A launched in June 2015. The study confirmed the advantages of several spectral indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ({NDVI}), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ({GNDVI}), Normalized Burn Ratio ({NBR}) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ({NDVIreXn}) using red-edge spectral bands to assess the post-fire conditions. Results showed high correlation between {NDVI}, {GNDVI}, {NBR} and {NDVIre}1n spectral indices and the analysis performed by Copernicus Emergency Management Service ({EMSR}175), considered as the reference truth. Regarding the red-edge spectral indices, the {NDVIre}1n (using band B5, 705nm) presented better results compared with B6 (740nm) and B7 (783nm) bands. These preliminary results allow us to assume that Sentinel-2 will be a valuable tool for post-fire monitoring. In the future, the two twin Sentinel-2 satellites will offer global coverage of the Madeira Archipelago every five days, therefore allowing the simultaneous study of the evolution of the burnt area and reforestation information with high spatial (up to 10m) and temporal resolution (5days).},

	abstract = {Accurate assessment of above-ground biomass ({AGB}) is important for the sustainable management of forests, especially buffer zone (areas within the protected area, where restrictions are placed upon resource use and special measure are undertaken to intensify the conservation value of protected area) areas with a high dependence on forest products. This study presents a new {AGB} estimation method and demonstrates the potential of medium-resolution Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument ({MSI}) data application as an alternative to hyperspectral data in inaccessible regions. Sentinel-2 performance was evaluated for a buffer zone community forest in Parsa National Park, Nepal, using field-based {AGB} as a dependent variable, as well as spectral band values and spectral-derived vegetation indices as independent variables in the Random Forest ({RF}) algorithm. The 10-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate model effectiveness. The effect of the input variable number on {AGB} prediction was also investigated. The model using all extracted spectral information plus all derived spectral vegetation indices provided better {AGB} estimates (R2 = 0.81 and {RMSE} = 25.57 t ha−1). Incorporating the optimal subset of key variables did not improve model variance but reduced the error slightly. This result is explained by the technically-advanced nature of Sentinel-2, which includes fine spatial resolution (10, 20 m) and strategically-positioned bands (red-edge), conducted in flat topography with an advanced machine learning algorithm. However, assessing its transferability to other forest types with varying altitude would enable future performance and interpretability assessments of Sentinel-2.},

	abstract = {The {UNFCCC} and interest in the source of the missing terrestrial carbon sink are prompting research and development into methods for carbon accounting in forest ecosystems. Here we present a canopy height quantile-based approach for quantifying above ground carbon content ({AGCC}) in a temperate deciduous woodland, by means of a discrete-return, small-footprint airborne {LiDAR}. Fieldwork was conducted in Monks Wood National Nature Reserve {UK} to estimate the {AGCC} of five stands from forest mensuration and allometric relations. In parallel, a digital canopy height model ({DCHM}) and a digital terrain model ({DTM}) were derived from elevation measurements obtained by means of an Optech Airborne Laser Terrain Mapper 1210. A quantile-based approach was adopted to select a representative statistic of height distributions per plot. A forestry yield model was selected as a basis to estimate stemwood volume per plot from these heights metrics. Agreement of r=0.74 at the plot level was achieved between ground-based {AGCC} estimates and those derived from the {DCHM}. Using a 20×20 m grids superposed to the {DCHM}, the {AGCC} was estimated at the stand level and at the woodland level. At the stand level, the agreement between the plot data upscaled in proportion to area and the {LiDAR} estimates was r=0.85. At the woodland level, {LiDAR} estimates were nearly 24\% lower than those from the upscaled plot data. This suggests that field-based approaches alone may not be adequate for carbon accounting in heterogeneous forests. Conversely, the {LiDAR} 20×20 m grid approach has an enhanced capability of monitoring the natural variability of {AGCC} across the woodland.},

	abstract = {A locally-adapted multitemporal two-phase burned area ({BA}) algorithm has been developed using as inputs Sentinel-2 {MSI} reflectance measurements in the short and near infrared wavebands plus the active fires detected by Terra and Aqua {MODIS} sensors. An initial burned area map is created in the first step, from which tile dependent statistics are extracted for the second step. The whole Sub-Saharan Africa (around 25 M km2) was processed with this algorithm at a spatial resolution of 20 m, from January to December 2016. This period covers two half fire seasons on the Northern Hemisphere and an entire fire season in the South. The area was selected as existing {BA} products account it to include around 70\% of global {BA}. Validation of this product was based on a two-stage stratified random sampling of Landsat multitemporal images. Higher accuracy values than existing global {BA} products were observed, with Dice coefficient of 77\% and omission and commission errors of 26.5\% and 19.3\% respectively. The standard {NASA} {BA} product ({MCD}64A1 c6) showed a similar commission error (20.4\%), but much higher omission errors (59.6\%), with a lower Dice coefficient (53.6\%). The {BA} algorithm was processed over {\textgreater}11,000 Sentinel-2 images to create a database that would also include small fires ({\textless}100 ha). This is the first time a continental {BA} product is generated from medium resolution sensors (spatial resolution = 20 m), showing their operational potential for improving our current understanding of global fire impacts. Total {BA} estimated from our product was 4.9 M km2, around 80\% larger area than what the {NASA} {BA} product ({MCD}64A1 c6) detected in the same period (2.7 M km2). The main differences between the two products were found in regions where small fires ({\textless}100 ha) account for a significant proportion of total {BA}, as global products based on coarse pixel sizes (500 m for {MCD}64A1) unlikely detect them. On the negative side, Sentinel-2 based products have lower temporal resolution and consequently are more affected by cloud/cloud shadows and have less temporal reporting accuracy than global {BA} products. The product derived from S2 imagery would greatly contribute to better understanding the impacts of small fires in global fire regimes, particularly in tropical regions, where such fires are frequent. This product is named {FireCCISFD}11 and it is publicly available at: https://www.esa-fire-cci.org/node/262, last accessed on November 2018.},

Lower yield predictions from sensor readings obtained from other parts of the field outside of the N non-limiting standard area indicate a need for supplemental N. Active-optical sensor algorithms for predicting corn (Zea mays, L.) yield to direct in-season nitrogen (N) fertilization in corn utilize red {NDVI} (normalized differential vegetative index). Use of red edge {NDVI} might improve corn yield prediction at later growth stages when corn leaves cover the inter-row space resulting in “saturation” of red {NDVI} readings. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the use of red edge {NDVI} in two active-optical sensors ({GreenSeeker}™ and Holland Scientific Crop Circle™) improved corn yield prediction. Nitrogen rate experiments were established at 15 sites in North Dakota ({ND}). Sensor readings were conducted at V6 and V12 corn. Red {NDVI} and red edge {NDVI} were similar in the relationship of readings with yield at V6. At V12, the red edge {NDVI} was superior to the red {NDVI} in most comparisons, indicating that it would be most useful in developing late-season N application algorithms.},

	abstract = {Numerous airborne {LiDAR}-derived metrics have been proposed for classifying tree species. Yet an in-depth ecological and biological understanding of the significance of these metrics for tree species mapping remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we evaluated the performance of 37 frequently used {LiDAR} metrics derived under leaf-on and leaf-off conditions, respectively, for discriminating six different tree species in a natural forest in Germany. We firstly assessed the correlation between these metrics. Then we applied a Random Forest algorithm to classify the tree species and evaluated the importance of the {LiDAR} metrics. Finally, we identified the most important {LiDAR} metrics and tested their robustness and transferability. Our results indicated that about 60\% of {LiDAR} metrics were highly correlated to each other ({\textbar}r{\textbar} {\textgreater} 0.7). There was no statistically significant difference in tree species mapping accuracy between the use of leaf-on and leaf-off {LiDAR} metrics. However, combining leaf-on and leaf-off {LiDAR} metrics significantly increased the overall accuracy from 58.2\% (leaf-on) and 62.0\% (leaf-off) to 66.5\% as well as the kappa coefficient from 0.47 (leaf-on) and 0.51 (leaf-off) to 0.58. Radiometric features, especially intensity related metrics, provided more consistent and significant contributions than geometric features for tree species discrimination. Specifically, the mean intensity of first-or-single returns as well as the mean value of echo width were identified as the most robust {LiDAR} metrics for tree species discrimination. These results indicate that metrics derived from airborne {LiDAR} data, especially radiometric metrics, can aid in discriminating tree species in a mixed temperate forest, and represent candidate metrics for tree species classification and monitoring in Central Europe.},

	abstract = {Leaf pigment content can provide valuable insight into the physiological performance of leaves. Measurement of spectral reflectance provides a fast, nondestructive method for pigment estimation. A large number of spectral indices have been developed for estimation of leaf pigment content. However, in most cases these indices have been tested for only one or at most a few related species and thus it is not clear whether they can be applied across species with varying leaf structural characteristics. Our objective in this study was to develop spectral indices for prediction of leaf pigment content that are relatively insensitive to species and leaf structure variation and thus could be applied in larger scale remote-sensing studies without extensive calibration. We also quantified the degree of spectral interference between pigments when multiple pigments occur within the same leaf tissue. We found that previously published spectral indices provided relatively poor correlations with leaf chlorophyll content when applied across a wide range of species and plant functional types. Leaf surface reflectance appeared to be the most important factor in this variation. By developing a new spectral index that reduces the effect of differences in leaf surface reflectance, we were able to significantly improve the correlations with chlorophyll content. We also found that an index based on the first derivative of reflectance in the red edge region was insensitive to leaf structural variation. The presence of other pigments did not significantly affect estimation of chlorophyll from spectral reflectance. Previously published carotenoid and anthocyanin indices performed poorly across the whole data set. However, we found that the photochemical reflectance index ({PRI}, originally developed for estimation of xanthophyll cycle pigment changes) was related to carotenoid/chlorophyll ratios in green leaves. This result has important implications for the interpretation of {PRI} measured at both large and small scales. Our results demonstrate that spectral indices can be applied across species with widely varying leaf structure without the necessity for extensive calibration for each species. This opens up new possibilities for assessment of vegetation health in heterogeneous natural environments.},

In addition, the corresponding green and red linear combinations were evaluated for comparative purposes. Three data sets were used from June, September, and October sampling periods. Regression analysis showed the increased utility of the {IR} and red linear combinations vis-à-vis the same green and red linear combinations. The red and {IR} linear combinations had 7\% and 14\% greater regression significance than the green and red linear combinations for the June and September sampling periods, respectively. The vegetation index, transformed vegetation index, and square root of the {IR}/red ratio were the most significant, followed closely by the {IR}/red ratio. Less than a 6\% difference separated the highest and lowest of these four {ER} and red linear combinations. The use of these linear combinations was shown to be sensitive primarily to the green leaf area or green leaf biomass. As such, these linear combinations of the red and photographic {IR} radiances can be employed to monitor the photosynthetically active biomass of plant canopies.},

	abstract = {Above-ground biomass ({AGB}) is a trait with much potential for exploitation within wheat breeding programmes and is linked closely to canopy height ({CH}). However, collecting phenotypic data for {AGB} and {CH} within breeding programmes is labour intensive, and in the case of {AGB}, destructive and prone to assessment error. As a result, measuring these traits is seldom a priority for breeders, especially at the early stages of a selection programme. {LiDAR} has been demonstrated as a sensor capable of collecting three-dimensional data from wheat field trials, and potentially suitable for providing objective, non-destructive, high-throughput estimates of {AGB} and {CH} for use by wheat breeders. The current study investigates the deployment of a {LiDAR} system on a ground-based high-throughput phenotyping platform in eight wheat field trials across southern Australia, for the non-destructive estimate of {AGB} and {CH}. {LiDAR}-derived measurements were compared to manual measurements of {AGB} and {CH} collected at each site and assessed for their suitability of application within a breeding programme. Correlations between {AGB} and {LiDAR} Projected Volume ({LPV}) were generally strong (up to r = 0.86), as were correlations between {CH} and {LiDAR} Canopy Height ({LCH}) (up to r = 0.94). Heritability (H2) of {LPV} (H2 = 0.32 – 0.90) was observed to be greater than, or similar to, the heritability of {AGB} (H2 = 0.12 – 0.78) for the majority of measurements. A similar level of heritability was observed for {LCH} (H2 = 0.41 – 0.98) and {CH} (H2 = 0.49 – 0.98). Further to this, measurements of {LPV} and {LCH} were shown to be highly repeatable when collected from either the same or opposite direction of travel. {LiDAR} scans were collected at a rate of 2,400 plots per hour, with the potential to further increase throughput to 7,400 plots per hour. This research demonstrates the capability of {LiDAR} sensors to collect high-quality, non-destructive, repeatable measurements of {AGB} and {CH} suitable for use within both breeding and research programmes.},

This study investigated uncertainties of mapping aboveground forest carbon due to location errors of sample plots for Lin-An County of China. National forest inventory plot data and Landsat {TM} images were combined using co-simulation algorithm. The findings show that randomly perturbing plot locations within 10 distance intervals statistically did not result in biased population mean predictions of aboveground forest carbon at a significant level of 0.05, but increased root mean square errors of the maps. The perturbations weakened spatial autocorrelation of aboveground forest carbon and its correlation with spectral variables. The perturbed distances of 800 m or less did not obviously change the spatial distribution of predicted values. However, when the perturbed distances were 1600 m or larger, the correlation coefficients of the predicted values from the perturbed locations with those from the true plot locations statistically did not significantly differ from zero at a level of 0.05 and the spatial distributions became random.},

	abstract = {Mapping mangrove extent and species is important for understanding their response to environmental changes and for observing their integrity for providing goods and services. However, accurately mapping mangrove extent and species are ongoing challenges in remote sensing. The newly-launched and freely-available Sentinel-2 (S2) sensor offers a new opportunity for these challenges. This study presents the first study dedicated to the examination of the potential of original bands, spectral indices, and texture information of S2 in mapping mangrove extent and species in the first National Nature Reserve for mangroves in Dongzhaigang, China. To map mangrove extent and species, a three-level hierarchical structure based on the spatial structure of a mangrove ecosystem and geographic object-based image analysis is utilized and modified. During the experiments, to conquer the challenge of optimizing high-dimension and correlated feature space, the recursive feature elimination ({RFE}) algorithm is introduced. Finally, the selected features from {RFE} are employed in mangrove species discriminations, based on a random forest algorithm. The results are compared with those of Landsat 8 (L8) and Pl\&eacute;iades-1 (P1) data and show that S2 and L8 could accurately extract mangrove extent, but P1 obviously overestimated it. Regarding mangrove species community levels, the overall classification accuracy of S2 is 70.95\%, which is lower than P1 imagery (78.57\%) and slightly higher than L8 data (68.57\%). Meanwhile, the former difference is statistically significant, and the latter is not. The dominant species is extracted basically in S2 and P1 imagery, but for the occasionally distributed K. candel and the pioneer and fringe mangrove A. marina, S2 performs poorly. Concerning L8, S2, and P1, there are eight (8/126), nine (9/218), and eight (8/73) features, respectively, that are the most important for mangrove species discriminations. The most important feature overall is the red-edge bands, followed by shortwave infrared, near infrared, blue, and other visible bands in turn. This study demonstrates that the S2 sensor can accurately map mangrove extent and basically discriminate mangrove species communities, but for the latter, one should be cautious due to the complexity of mangrove species.},

To fill the gap and address this issue, this study proposed a novel upscaling method for mangrove {AGB} estimation using field plots, {UAV}-{LiDAR} strip data and Sentinel-2 imagery (named G∼{LiDAR}∼S2 model) based on a point-line-polygon framework. In this model, the partial-coverage {UAV}-{LiDAR} data were used as a linear bridge to link ground measurements to the wall-to-wall coverage Sentinel-2 data. The results showed that northeast Hainan Island has a total mangrove {AGB} of 312,806.29 Mg with a mean {AGB} of 119.26 Mg ha−1. The results also indicated that at the regional scale, the proposed {UAV}-{LiDAR} linear bridge method (i.e., G∼{LiDAR}∼S2 model) performed better than the traditional approach, which directly relates field plots to Sentinel-2 data (named the G∼S2 model) (R2 = 0.62 {\textgreater} 0.52, {RMSE} = 50.36 Mg ha−1{\textless}56.63 Mg ha−1). Through a trend extrapolation method, this study inferred that the G∼{LiDAR}∼S2 model could decrease the number of field samples required by approximately 37\% in comparison with those required by the G∼S2 model in the study area. Regarding the {UAV}-{LiDAR} sampling intensity, compared with the original number of {LiDAR} plots, 20\% of original linear bridges could produce an acceptable accuracy (R2 = 0.62, {RMSE} = 51.03 Mg ha−1). Consequently, this study presents the first investigation of {AGB} for the mangrove forests on northeast Hainan Island in China and verifies the feasibility of using this mangrove {AGB} upscaling method for diverse mangrove forests.},

This study aims to upscale the forest carbon estimates using {GeoEye}-1 image and small footprint lidar data from small areas to a landscape level using {RapidEye} image. Species stratification was carried out based on the spectral separability curve of {GeoEye}-1 image, and comparison of mean intensity and mean plot height of the trees from lidar data. {GeoEye}-1 image and lidar data were segmented using region growing approach to delineate individual tree crowns; and the segmented crowns ({CPA}) of tree were further used to establish a relationship with field measured carbon and total trees’ height. Carbon stock measured from field, individual tree crown ({ITC}) segmentation approach and area-based approach ({ABA}) was compared at plot level using one-way {ANOVA} and post hoc Tukey comparison test. {ITC}-based carbon estimates was used to establish a relationship with spectral reflectance of {RapidEye} image variables ({NDVI}, {RedEdge} {NDVI}, {PC}1, single band of {RedEdge}, and {NIR}) to upscale the carbon at landscape level. One-way {ANOVA} resulted in a highly significant difference (p-value {\textless} 0.005) between the mean plot height and lidar intensity to stratify Shorea robusta and Other species successfully. {ITC} carbon stock estimation models of two major tree species explained about 88\% and 79\% of the variances, respectively, at 95\% confidence level. The {ABA} estimated carbon was highly correlated (R2 = 0.83, {RMSE} = 20.04) to field measured carbon with higher accuracy than the {ITC} estimated carbon. A weak relationship was observed between the carbon stock and the {RapidEye} image variables. However, upscaling of carbon estimates from {ABA} is likely to improve the relationship of the {RapidEye} variables rather than upscaling the carbon estimates from {ITC} approach.},

	abstract = {Among vegetated coastal habitats, mangrove forests are among the densest carbon pools. They store their organic carbon in the surrounding soil and thus the sequestered carbon stays in the sediment for a long time and cannot be easily returned to the atmosphere. Additionally, mangroves also provide various important ecosystem services in coastal areas and surroundings. Accordingly, it is important to understand the distribution of biomass carbon stock in mangrove habitats in a spatial and temporal context, not only to reduce {CO}2 concentrations in the atmosphere, but also for their sustainability. The objectives of this research are to map the mangrove carbon stock and estimate the total biomass carbon stock sheltered by mangrove forests, with the Karimunjawa Islands as a study site, using the widely available passive remote sensing system {ALOS} {AVNIR}-2. The modelling and mapping of mangrove carbon stock incorporates the integration of image pixel values and mangroves field data via empirical modelling. Vegetation indices and {PC} bands at different levels of radiometric corrections were all used as the input in the mangrove carbon stock modelling so that the effectiveness and sensitivity of different image transformations to particular radiometric correction levels could be analysed and understood. Afterward, the accuracy and effectiveness of each mangrove carbon stock-mapping routine was compared and evaluated. The accuracy of the best mangrove above-ground carbon stock ({AGC}) map modelled from vegetation index is 77.1\% ({EVI}1, {SE} 5.89 kg C m−2), and for mangrove below-ground carbon stock ({BGC}) it is 60.0\% ({GEMI}, {SE} 2.54 kg C m−2). The mangrove carbon stock map from {ALOS} {AVNIR}-2 {PC} bands showed a maximum accuracy of 77.8\% ({PC}2, {SE} 5.71 kg C m−2) and 60.8\% ({PC}2, {SE} 2.48 kg C m−2) for {AGC} and {BGC} respectively. From the resulting maps, the Karimunjawa Islands are estimated to shelter 96,482 tonnes C of mangroves {AGC} with a mean value of 21.64 kg C m−2 and 24,064 tonnes C of mangroves {BGC} with a mean value of 5.39 kg C m−2. Potentially, there are approximately 120,546 tonnes C of mangrove biomass carbon stock in the Karimunjawa Islands. Remote-sensing reflectance can successfully model mangrove carbon stock based on the relationship between mangrove canopy properties, represented by leaf area index ({LAI}) and the tree or root biomass carbon stock. The accuracy of the mangrove carbon stock map is subject to errors, which are sourced mainly from: (1) the absence of a species-specific biomass allometric equation for several species present in the study area; (2) the generalized standard conversion value of mangrove biomass to mangrove carbon stock; (3) the relationship between mangrove reflectance and mangrove {LAI}; (4) the relationship between mangrove reflectance and above-ground mangrove biomass and carbon stock due to its relationship with {LAI}; (5) the relationship between mangrove {LAI} and mangrove below-ground parts; (6) the inability to perform mangrove carbon stock modelling at the species level due to the complexities of the mangrove forest in the study area; (7) background reflectance and atmospheric path radiance that could not be completely minimized using image radiometric corrections and transformations; and (8) spatial displacement between the actual location of the mangrove forest in the field and the corresponding pixel in the image. The availability of mangrove biomass carbon stock maps is beneficial for carrying out various management activities, and is also very important for the resilience of mangroves to changing environments.},

This paper proposes an improved progressive triangulated irregular network ({TIN}) densification ({IPTD}) filtering algorithm that can cope with a variety of forested landscapes, particularly both topographically and environmentally complex regions. The {IPTD} filtering algorithm consists of three steps: (1) acquiring potential ground seed points using the morphological method; (2) obtaining accurate ground seed points; and (3) building a {TIN}-based model and iteratively densifying {TIN}. The {IPTD} filtering algorithm was tested in 15 forested sites with various terrains (i.e., elevation and slope) and vegetation conditions (i.e., canopy cover and tree height), and was compared with seven other commonly used filtering algorithms (including morphology-based, slope-based, and interpolation-based filtering algorithms). Results show that the {IPTD} achieves the highest filtering accuracy for nine of the 15 sites. In general, it outperforms the other filtering algorithms, yielding the lowest average total error of 3.15\% and the highest average kappa coefficient of 89.53\%.},

	abstract = {To accurately estimate leaf area index ({LAI}) in mangrove areas, the selection of appropriate models and predictor variables is critical. However, there is a major challenge in quantifying and mapping {LAI} using multi-spectral sensors due to the saturation effects of traditional vegetation indices ({VIs}) for mangrove forests. {WorldView}-2 ({WV}2) imagery has proven to be effective to estimate {LAI} of grasslands and forests, but the sensitivity of its vegetation indices ({VIs}) has been uncertain for mangrove forests. Furthermore, the single model may exhibit certain randomness and instability in model calibration and estimation accuracy. Therefore, this study aims to explore the sensitivity of {WV}2 {VIs} for estimating mangrove {LAI} by comparing artificial neural network regression ({ANNR}), support vector regression ({SVR}) and random forest regression ({RFR}). The results suggest that the {RFR} algorithm yields the best results ({RMSE} = 0.45, 14.55\% of the average {LAI}), followed by {ANNR} ({RMSE} = 0.49, 16.04\% of the average {LAI}), and then {SVR} ({RMSE} = 0.51, 16.56\% of the average {LAI}) algorithms using 5-fold cross validation ({CV}) using all {VIs}. Quantification of the variable importance shows that the {VIs} derived from the red-edge band consistently remain the most important contributor to {LAI} estimation. When the red-edge band-derived {VIs} are removed from the models, estimation accuracies measured in relative {RMSE} ({RMSEr}) decrease by 3.79\%, 2.70\% and 4.47\% for {ANNR}, {SVR} and {RFR} models respectively. {VIs} derived from red-edge band also yield better accuracy compared with other traditional bands of {WV}2, such as near-infrared-1 and near-infrared-2 band. Furthermore, the estimated {LAI} values vary significantly across different mangrove species. The study demonstrates the utility of {VIs} of {WV}2 imagery and the selected machine-learning algorithms in developing {LAI} models in mangrove forests. The results indicate that the red-edge band of {WV}2 imagery can help alleviate the saturation problem and improve the accuracy of {LAI} estimation in a mangrove area.},

	abstract = {The value of combining Landsat time series and airborne laser scanning ({ALS}) data to produce regional maps of forest structure has been well documented. However, studies are often performed over single study areas or forest types, preventing a robust assessment of the approaches that produce the most accurate estimates. Here, we use Landsat time series data to estimate forest attributes across six Canadian study sites, which vary by forest type, productivity, management regime, and disturbance history, with the goal of investigating which spectral indices and time series lengths yield the most accurate estimates of forest attributes across a range of conditions. We use estimates of stand height, basal area, and stem volume derived from {ALS} data as calibration and validation data, and develop random forest models to estimate forest structure with Landsat time series data and topographic variables at each site. Landsat time series predictors, which were derived from annual gap-free image composites, included the median, interquartile range, and Theil Sen slope of vegetation indices through time. To investigate the optimal time series length for predictor variables, time series length was varied from 1 to 33 years. Across all six sites, increasing the time series length led to improved estimation accuracy, however the optimal time series length was not consistent across sites. Specifically, model accuracies plateaued at a time series length of {\textasciitilde}15 years for two sites (R2 = 0.67–0.74), while the accuracies continued to increase until the maximum time series length was reached (24–29 years) for the remaining four sites (R2 = 0.45–0.70). Spectral indices that relied on shortwave infrared bands (Tasseled Cap Wetness and Normalized Burn Ratio) were frequently the most important spectral indices. Adding Landsat-derived disturbance variables (time since last disturbance, type of disturbance) did not meaningfully improve model results; however, this finding was largely due to the fact that most recently disturbed stands did not have predictions of forest attributes from {ALS}, so disturbed sites were poorly represented in the models. As model accuracies varied regionally and no optimal time series length was found, we provide an approach that can be utilized to determine the optimal time series length on a case by case basis, allowing users to extrapolate estimates of forest attributes both spatially and temporally using multispectral time series data.},

Furthermore, the spatial and temporal information extracted from the time-series data enables the attribution of various forest change types over large areas. In this paper we apply spectral trend analysis of Landsat Thematic Mapper ({TM}) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus ({ETM}+) data from 1984 to 2012 to detect, characterize, and attribute forest changes in the province of Saskatchewan, Canada. Change detection is performed using breakpoint analysis of the spectral trends and change events are characterized using a set of metrics derived from an image time series that relate the temporal, spectral, and geometrical properties on an object basis. Change objects are attributed to a change type (i.e., fire, harvesting, road, and non-stand-replacing changes) using a Random Forest classifier. Non-stand-replacing changes are generally low magnitude, punctual, trend anomalies that relate year-on-year ephemeral changes that do not lead to a change in land cover class (i.e., phenology, insects, water stress). The results confirm that land cover changes are detected with high overall accuracy (92.2\%), with the majority of changes labeled to the correct occurrence year (91.1\%) or within ±1year (98.7\%). Characterization of changes enables accurate attribution both at the object (91.6\%) and area levels (98\%), with fire and harvesting events the most successfully attributed (commission error{\textless}10\%), and roads, the most challenging to attribute correctly (commission error{\textgreater}13\%). Our approach, prototyped over the forested area of Saskatchewan, has enabled a highly automated and systematic depiction of a 30-year history of forest change, providing otherwise unavailable insights on disturbance trends including spatial, temporal, and categorical characteristics. The generation and application of metrics that relate a range of change characteristics allow for depiction of a broad range of change events, types, and conditions.},

Change attribution overall accuracy was 92\%, with higher accuracy for stand-replacing wildfire and harvest. Changes were assigned to the correct year with an accuracy of 89\%.

	abstract = {Mapping and monitoring land cover and land cover change remains a top priority for land managers. Uniquely, remote sensing offers the capacity to acquire information in a systematic (spatially, temporally, and categorically) and synoptic fashion that is appealing from monitoring and reporting perspectives. The opening of the Landsat archive and new processing and analysis opportunities enable the characterization of large areas and the generation of dynamic, transparent, systematic, repeatable, and spatially exhaustive information products. Best Available Pixel ({BAP}) approaches enable the production of periodic image composites free of haze, clouds, or shadows over large areas. In this paper we demonstrate an integrated protocol to produce spatially exhaustive annual {BAP} image composites that are seasonally constrained and free of atmospheric perturbations. These annual {BAP} composites for the years inclusive of 1998 to 2010 provide for generation of a suite of change metrics for the period 2000 to 2010 using Landsat Thematic Mapper ({TM}) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus ({ETM}+) data. The study area is the {\textgreater}375,000km2 forested area of Saskatchewan, Canada. We evaluate the robustness of the protocol by comparing in-filled (or proxy) values with a true reference set for surface reflectance. An initial change detection pass is used to aid in the allocation of proxy values (for missing and anomalous values) and to allocate change events to the correct year, with a second pass to characterize key change points and related time series trends (e.g., change year, post-change slopes, among others). In so doing, a multi-temporal data cube (via a series of annual proxy composites) and a set of change metrics are generated. Approximately 35\% of the pixels in our study area required proxy values, either as a result of missing data or our noise detection approach. Overall, our results indicate strong agreement between the assigned proxy values and the reference data (R=0.71–0.91, {RMSE}=0.008–0.025). Agreement was stronger for pixel series with no change events (R=0.73–0.92, {RMSE}=0.007–0.024), relative to pixel series with change events (R=0.63–0.87, {RMSE}=0.010–0.029). The generated change metrics, derived via temporal and spatial analysis of the annual {BAP} composites, were an important precursor to the generation of valid proxy values, and – importantly – provide valuable information for the further assessment and understanding of land cover and land cover change. Our results indicate that the demonstrated protocol provides a reliable approach to generate proxy image composites containing no data gaps, along with a suite of informative change metrics that provide a comprehensive characterization of land cover changes (including disturbance and recovery) allowing for an improved understanding of landscape dynamics. The protocol is efficient and may be applied over large areas to support regional and national mapping and monitoring activities.},

	abstract = {Landscape Assessment primarily addresses the need to identify and quantify fire effects over large areas, at times involving many burns. In contrast to individual case studies, the ability to compare results is emphasized along with the capacity to aggregate information across broad regions and over time. Results show the spatial heterogeneity of burns and how fire interacts with vegetation and topography. The quantity measured and mapped is "burn severity," defined here as a scaled index gauging the magnitude of ecological change caused by fire. In the process, two methodologies are integrated. Burn Remote Sensing ({BR}) involves remote sensing with Landsat 30-meter data and a derived radiometric value called the Normalized Burn Ratio ({NBR}). The {NBR} is temporally differenced between pre- and postfire datasets to determine the extent and degree of change detected from burning (fig. {LA}-1). Two timeframes of acquisition identify effects soon after fire and during the next growing season for Initial and Extended Assessments, respectively. The latter includes vegetative recovery potential and delayed mortality. The Burn Index ({BI}) adds a complementary field sampling approach, called the Composite Burn Index ({CBI}). It entails a relatively large plot, independent severity ratings for individual strata, and a synoptic rating for the whole plot area. Plot sampling may be used to.},

Best-available-pixel ({BAP}) composites represent a new paradigm in remote sensing that is no longer reliant on scene-based analysis. A time series of these {BAP} image composites affords novel opportunities to generate information products characterizing land cover, land cover change, and forest structural attributes in a manner that is dynamic, transparent, systematic, repeatable, and spatially exhaustive. Herein, we articulate the information needs associated with forest ecosystem science and monitoring in a Canadian context, and indicate how these new image compositing approaches and subsequent derived products can enable us to address these needs. We highlight some of the issues and opportunities associated with an image compositing approach and demonstrate annual composite products at a national-scale for a single year, with more detailed analyses for two prototype areas using 15 years of Landsat data. Recommendations concerning how to best link compositing decisions to the desired use of the composite (and the information need) are presented, along with future research directions.},

	abstract = {In the context of complex demands on forest resources and climate change, synoptic and spatially-explicit baseline data characterizing national trends in forest disturbance and subsequent return of vegetation (and eventual return to forest) are increasingly required. Time series analyses of remotely sensed data enable the retrospective generation of baseline data depicting both forest disturbance and recovery, enabling a more holistic examination of forest dynamics. In this research, we utilize the outputs of the Composite2Change, or C2C, algorithm that leverages the extensive Landsat archive to produce annual, gap-free, surface reflectance composites to date and label disturbance types and to characterize vegetation recovery over the {\textgreater}650 million ha of Canada's forested ecosystems. From 1985 to 2010, 57.5Mha or 10.75\% of Canada's net forested ecosystem area (exclusive of water) were disturbed by either wildfire or harvest, representing an annual rate of disturbance of approximately 0.43\% per year. Wildfire accounted for 2.5 times more area disturbed than harvest. On average, wildfire disturbed 1.6Mha annually and had greater inter-annual variability with a standard deviation of 1.1Mha, compared to the 0.65Mha disturbed annually by harvesting (σ=0.1Mha). Herein, we defined a longer-term measure of spectral recovery (the number of years it took for a pixel to attain 80\% of its pre-disturbance Normalized Burn Ratio or {NBR} value), which indicated that harvested areas are recovering more consistently over time relative to areas disturbed by wildfire, with 78.6\% of harvested areas requiring ≤10years to recover, compared to only 35.5\% of wildfire areas. A shorter-term (5-year) measure of spectral recovery, also based on the {NBR}, indicated that vegetation in wildfire areas returned more rapidly than harvested areas; however, when the magnitude of the disturbance was incorporated into the metric, with magnitude typically larger and more variable for wildfire areas, harvested areas were found to be recovering more rapidly on average in the short-term. Overall, {\textless}1\% of the areas disturbed by wildfire and harvest were identified as non-recovering by all three spectral measures of recovery used in our analysis. Regionally, trends in disturbance and recovery largely echoed trends found at the national level, although the relative amounts and rates of wildfire or harvest varied by ecozone. Time series Landsat composites provide an opportunity to characterize relative trends in disturbance and recovery at a national scale, by disturbance type and ecozone, in a spatially explicit manner and at a level of spatial detail that is relevant to both forest management and science.},

	abstract = {Forests are dynamic ecosystems, subject to both natural and anthropogenic agents of change. Wildfire, harvesting and other human activities alter the tree-covered area present in forests. From national and international reporting perspectives, forests include areas currently treed, as well as those disturbed forest areas that are not currently treed but will be, given time for regeneration and the advancement of natural successional processes. As a consequence, forest area can be depicted at a particular point in time, informed by a retrospective temporal context. Using time series of Landsat imagery, annual land cover maps can be generated that are informed by knowledge of past disturbance history (such as wildfire and harvesting). In this research, we use over three decades of annual land cover data generated from Landsat time series to generate a spatially explicit estimate of the forest area of Canada in 2010. We demonstrate how land cover and disturbance information can be combined to map the area of ‘forest’, as defined by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations ({FAO}), within Canada’s 650 Mha of forested ecozones. Following this approach, we estimated Canada’s total forest area in 2010 to be 354.5 Mha. This estimate includes 324.5 Mha of current forest cover in 2010, plus an additional 33.2 Mha (or 9.4 per cent) of temporally informed forest area where tree cover had been temporarily lost due to fire or harvest, less 3.3 Mha that were removed to meet a definitional minimum size (0.5 ha) for contiguous forest area. Using Canada’s National Forest Inventory ({NFI}) as an independent reference source, the spatial agreement between the two estimates of forest area was {\textasciitilde}84 per cent overall. Aspatially, the total area of the Landsat-derived estimate of 2010 forest area and the {NFI} baseline estimates differed by only 3 per cent, with notable regional differences in the wetland-dominated Hudson Plains Ecozone. Satellite-derived time series land cover and change information enable spatially explicit depictions of forest area (distinct from representations of forest cover) in a robust and transparent fashion, producing information of value to science, management and reporting information needs.},

	abstract = {This study investigated how lidar-derived vegetation indices, disturbance history from Landsat time series ({LTS}) imagery, plot location accuracy, and plot size influenced accuracy of statistical spatial models (nearest-neighbor imputation maps) of forest vegetation composition and structure. Nearest-neighbor ({NN}) imputation maps were developed for 539,000ha in the central Oregon Cascades, {USA}. Mapped explanatory data included tasseled-cap indices and disturbance history metrics (year, magnitude, and duration of disturbance) from {LTS} imagery, lidar-derived vegetation metrics, climate, topography, and soil parent material. Vegetation data from {USDA} Forest Service forest inventory plots was summarized at two plot sizes (plot and subplot) and geographically located with two levels of accuracy (standard and improved). Maps of vegetation composition and structure were developed with the Gradient Nearest Neighbor ({GNN}) method of {NN} imputation using different combinations of explanatory variables, plot spatial resolution, and plot positional accuracy. Lidar vegetation indices greatly improved predictions of live tree structure, moderately improved predictions of snag density and down wood volume, but did not consistently improve species predictions. {LTS} disturbance metrics improved predictions of forest structure, but not to the degree of lidar indices, while also improving predictions of many species. Absence of disturbance attribution (i.e. disturbance type such as fire or timber harvest) in {LTS} disturbance metrics may have limited our ability to predict forest structure. Absence of corrected lidar intensity values may also have lowered accuracy of snag and species predictions. However, {LTS} disturbance attribution and lidar corrected intensity values may not be able to overcome fundamental limitations of remote sensing for predicting snags and down wood that are obscured by the forest canopy. Improved {GPS} plot locations had little influence on map accuracy, and we suggest under what conditions improved {GPS} plot locations may or may not improve the accuracy of predictive maps that link remote sensing with forest inventory plots. Subplot {NN} imputation maps had much lower accuracy compared to maps generated using response variables from larger whole plots. No single map had optimal results for every mapped variable, suggesting map users and developers need to prioritize what forest vegetation attributes are most important for any given map application.},

	abstract = {Passive optical remotely sensed images such as those from the Landsat satellites enable the development of spatially comprehensive, well-calibrated reflectance measures that support large-area mapping. In recent years, as an alternative to field plot data, the use of Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) acquisitions for calibration and validation purposes in combination with such satellite reflectance data to model a range of forest structural response variables has become well established. In this research, we use a predictive modeling approach to map forest structural attributes over the {\textasciitilde}552millionha boreal forest of Canada. For model calibration and independent validation we utilize airborne lidar-derived measurements of forest vertical structure (known as lidar plots) obtained in 2010 via a {\textgreater}25,000km transect-based national survey. Models were developed linking the lidar plot structural variables to wall-to-wall 30-m spatial resolution surface reflectance composites derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus imagery. Spectral indices extracted from the composites, disturbance information (years since disturbance and type), as well as geographic position and topographic variables (i.e., elevation, slope, radiation, etc.) were considered as predictor variables. A nearest neighbor imputation approach based on the Random Forest framework was used to predict a total of 10 forest structural attributes. The model was developed and validated on {\textgreater}80,000 lidar plots, with R2 values ranging from 0.49 to 0.61 for key response variables such as canopy cover, stand height, basal area, stem volume, and aboveground biomass. Additionally, a predictor variable importance analysis confirmed that spectral indices, elevation, and geographic coordinates were key sources of information, ultimately offering an improved understanding of the driving variables for large-area forest structure modeling. This study demonstrates the integration of airborne lidar and Landsat-derived reflectance products to generate detailed and spatially extensive maps of forest structure. The methods are portable to map other attributes of interest (based upon calibration data) through access to Landsat or other appropriate optical remotely-sensed data sources, thereby offering unique opportunities for science, monitoring, and reporting programs.},

The study area included natural and planted mangroves of diverse species. After image preparation, three different mangrove associations were identified using two levels of image segmentation followed by a Support Vector Machine classifier and a range of spectral, texture and {GIS} information for classification. The overall classification accuracy for the 2000 and 2011 images were 77.1\% and 82.9\%, respectively. Random Forest regression algorithms were then used for modelling and mapping biomass. The model that integrated spectral, vegetation association type, texture, and vegetation indices obtained the highest accuracy (R2adj = 0.73). Among the different variables, vegetation association type was the most important variable identified by the Random Forest model. Based on the biomass maps generated from the Random Forest, total biomass in the Cangio mangrove forest increased by 820,136tons over this period, although this change varied between the three different mangrove associations.},

	abstract = {The worldwide demand for timely and accurate information about ecosystem dynamics at Landsat spatial scale is growing and as of today still exceeds the availability of information. The diversity of required disturbance metrics and trade-offs between sensitivity, reliability, timelines of information generation, and flexibility toward potential customizations suggests that a single system is not likely to fill such demand in the near future. To address this challenge, the scientific community has been developing and improving various Landsat-based algorithms for land change monitoring. We describe the Ecosystem Disturbance and Recovery Tracker ({eDaRT}) version 2.9 — a highly automated prototype system in continuous development, which has been operated since 2012 by the {USDA} Forest Service Pacific Southwest Region to generate most current disturbance maps at Landsat scale and provide customized information services and inputs to science and land management applications in the Region. The {eDaRT} processing system utilizes all three dimensions of dense Landsat image time series: spectral, temporal, and spatial. Two anomaly detection algorithms are sequentially applied, one estimating pixels’ disturbance status metrics in every processed image and the other detecting disturbance events, the primary output of {eDaRT}. The first algorithm initially estimates change relative to a user-defined fixed baseline time period, using a stratified version of the Dynamic Detection Model ({DDM}; Koltunov et al., 2009) applied to Landsat bands and vegetation indexes that reflect canopy greenness, abundance, and moisture content. Using the model residuals and a probabilistic context analysis, the detected anomalies are further classified as disturbed, cloud/snow, or recovered. The resulting residuals, classification maps, and the associated disturbance confidence values provide the most rapid preliminary snapshot of the current cumulative effect of disturbance and regeneration. The second algorithm detects discrete disturbance events as regime changes in the dense time series of the residuals for each pixel. First, the residuals are compared against a recent baseline window and classified to find candidates for disturbance events. Next, candidate-events are accepted based on temporal consistency of their detection. The standard outputs from this algorithm include disturbance event timing (down to 8–16 day precision) and a detection confidence as a proxy for event magnitude. We initially evaluated {eDaRT} performance with high-resolution imagery and airborne {LiDAR} data in a test area in California for several types of annual disturbance events at 30-m scale. These tests modeled detection probabilities as functions of canopy cover loss, which estimated detection rates of 96\%, 87\% and 92\% respectively for fire, harvest, and tree mortality events, when canopy loss values follow a uniform prior distribution. The error of commission varied between 10- 20\% for most forest types (12\% on average). Following ongoing optimizations and extended validations, {eDaRT} will expand beyond Landsat instruments to improve ecosystem monitoring, as an independent system and potentially as a part of an ensemble method.},

	abstract = {The use of deep learning ({DL}) approaches for the analysis of remote sensing ({RS}) data is rapidly increasing. {DL} techniques have provided excellent results in applications ranging from parameter estimation to image classification and anomaly detection. Although the vast majority of studies report precision indicators, there is a lack of studies dealing with the interpretability of the predictions. This shortcoming hampers a wider adoption of {DL} approaches by a wider users community, as model’s decisions are not accountable. In applications that involve the management of public budgets or policy compliance, a better interpretability of predictions is strictly required. This work aims to deepen the understanding of a recurrent neural network for land use classification based on Sentinel-2 time series in the context of the European Common Agricultural Policy ({CAP}). This permits to address the relevance of predictors in the classification process leading to an improved understanding of the behaviour of the network. The conducted analysis demonstrates that the red and near infrared Sentinel-2 bands convey the most useful information. With respect to the temporal information, the features derived from summer acquisitions were the most influential. These results contribute to the understanding of models used for decision making in the {CAP} to accomplish the European Green Deal ({EGD}) designed in order to counteract climate change, to protect biodiversity and ecosystems, and to ensure a fair economic return for farmers.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in airborne light detection and ranging ({LIDAR}) technology allow rapid and inexpensive measurements of topography over large areas. This technology is becoming a primary method for generating high-resolution digital terrain models ({DTMs}) that are essential to numerous applications such as flood modeling and landslide prediction. Airborne {LIDAR} systems usually return a three-dimensional cloud of point measurements from reflective objects scanned by the laser beneath the flight path. In order to generate a {DTM}, measurements from nonground features such as buildings, vehicles, and vegetation have to be classified and removed. In this paper, a progressive morphological filter was developed to detect nonground {LIDAR} measurements. By gradually increasing the window size of the filter and using elevation difference thresholds, the measurements of vehicles, vegetation, and buildings are removed, while ground data are preserved. Datasets from mountainous and flat urbanized areas were selected to test the progressive morphological filter. The results show that the filter can remove most of the nonground points effectively.},
